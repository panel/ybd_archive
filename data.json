From that fortuitous day in July, 2009, we've moved from extract to all-grain, started kegging, had bottle bombs and tried to ferment sweet potato. We're far from experts, but we think we have some insights that people might find valuable. We've also made mistakes that we can help others avoid and learn from as well.\r\n\r\nLike everybody who brews, we enjoy beers that others make (you might call that our first love). We try to check out any local brewpub and look for the most ridiculous beers on the menu to try. Hopefully you can find some interesting stuff as we chronicle our adventure in beer and brewing.","post_title":"About","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"about","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-08-15 19:41:50","post_modified_gmt":"2010-08-16 02:41:50","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/?page_id=2","menu_order":"0","post_type":"page","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"2"},

It was amazingly simple.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect that made it simple was knowingi the  hang-ups from the first time.  Our kit came with a glass carboy which works fine for fermenting, but is a pain in the ass to mix with given its weight and the narrowness of the opening.  We spent $15 on a bottling bucket and it made the whole process a ton easier. Being able to pour the boil into the bucket and mix it with water to get up to the 5 gallon mark really cut down on the stress. It also allowed us to take an original gravity reading and spread the yeast evenly while mixing it in.\r\n\r\nFinally, buying three gallons of distilled water made life much less frantic. On our first brewday, we had to boil all the water that was going in, and to make matters worse, we didn't have a microwave on site.  Boiling the water made it even more difficult to try to get the wort down to temp quickly enough. We actually put the yeast in when the wort was probably over 100ºF, it's amazing it fermented at all. This time, we got the boil down to about 80ºF, and added 2 gallons of cold water and 1 gallon of room temperature water which got it right to 70ºF.\r\n\r\nWe're still having some problems getting the hard break with the boil. We tried an ice bath in the sink and it still took about 20-30 minutes.  We have a keg cooler that we can get our hands on for next time, so hopefully that will help. We're still using a cut open handle of gin as our funnel, mainly because it's awesome, and funnels are like $12.  We much prefer not spending the money and keeeping the hilarity of our improvised funnel.\r\n\r\nWe still have to bottle, and we're not quite set up perfectly for that.  The bucket with a spiget will certainly help, but we don't have a bottling wand or a short piece of tubing to fill the bottle with. Last time we bottled with a siphon, and that was a royal pain in the ass.  It should be much better this time.\r\n\r\nHopefully we can continue this upward trend. The first beer will most likely be drinkable, and it was a fun experience making it, but it did get frustrating and stressful when it looked like the beer might not work.  Now that we get the basic process pretty well, we can expand into some more complicated stuff.","post_title":"What We've Learned","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"what-weve-learned","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2009-06-09 12:11:59","post_modified_gmt":"2009-06-09 19:11:59","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/?p=31","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

We opened one bottle (there are still about 40 remaining, one of which we'll test for another status update in a week, and one of which we'll probably never open), and poured it into a pint glass, which the three of us shared.\r\n\r\nFirst things first: it was beer! Not rancid wheat-water, but actual pale ale. The physical appearance was about what you'd expect from a pale, but perhaps a little cloudier. There was a satisfying rush of gas when the top was popped. The head of the beer started pretty high, then went down about as you'd expect, with little lattice pattern.\r\n\r\nThe taste was good. It was still a little bitter, but since we were testing it long before secondary fermentation was complete, it will likely mellow out over the next couple weeks. There was a distinct hop flavor and aroma, though the bitter hop taste was rather biting on first sip, though it did leave a pleasant aftertaste.\r\n\r\nGiven our depressed expectiations after the slight fiasco that went down during the brewing fiasco, we exceeded our goal. Given a few a weeks it should be a very solid first effort. We can't wait for it to mature.","post_title":"Batch 1: First Taste","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"18-revision-4","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2009-06-08 13:13:06","post_modified_gmt":"2009-06-08 20:13:06","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"18","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/?p=38","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

We're still using a cut open handle of gin as our funnel, mainly because it's awesome, and funnels are like $12.  We much prefer not spending the money and keeeping the hilarity of our improvised funnel.\r\n\r\nWe still have to bottle, and we're not quite set up perfectly for that.  The bucket with a spiget will certainly help, but we don't have a bottling wand or a short piece of tubing to fill the bottle with. Last time we bottled with a siphon, and that was a royal pain in the ass.  It should be much better this time.\r\n\r\nHopefully we can continue this upward trend. The first beer will most likely be drinkable, and it was a fun experience making it, but it did get frustrating and stressful when it looked like the beer might not work.  Now that we get the basic process pretty well, we can expand into some more complicated stuff.","post_title":"What We've Learned","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"31-revision-4","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2009-06-09 11:41:12","post_modified_gmt":"2009-06-09 18:41:12","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"31","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/?p=46","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

We opened one bottle (there are still about 40 remaining, one of which we'll test for another status update in a week, and one of which we'll probably never open), and poured it into a pint glass, which the three of us shared.\r\n\r\nFirst things first: it was beer! Not rancid wheat-water, but actual pale ale. The physical appearance was about what you'd expect from a pale, but perhaps a little cloudier. There was a satisfying rush of gas when the top was popped. The head of the beer started pretty high, then went down about as you'd expect, with little lattice pattern.\r\n\r\nThe taste was good. It was still a little bitter, but since we were testing it long before secondary fermentation was complete, it will likely mellow out over the next couple weeks. There was a distinct hop flavor and aroma, though the bitter hop taste was rather biting on first sip, though it did leave a pleasant aftertaste.\r\n\r\nGiven our depressed expectiations after the slight fiasco that went down during the brewing fiasco, we exceeded our goal. Given a few a weeks it should be a very solid first effort. We can't wait for it to mature.","post_title":"Batch 1: First Taste","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"18-revision-8","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2009-06-09 13:01:03","post_modified_gmt":"2009-06-09 20:01:03","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"18","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/?p=65","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

We started off drinking Bell's Oberon, which most people in the region know, but being poor college kids\/poor college graduates, economics eventually took over.\r\n\r\nOne of the kids we were with had recently been in Cincinatti, Ohio where he found Bürger Light on sale for $2.99 for a six pack.  Naturally he picked up a few of them to bring back to Michigan.  After a few good beers, we decided our palates were numbed enough to give this beer a go.\r\n\r\nWe made sure to keep it extra cold. We didn't poor it into a glass because it would not have been worth the water\/soap to wash the glass afterward. I cracked mine open and took a sip and didn't really taste much of anything.  I guess water is the most drinkable and refreshing liquid on the Earth, so if those are the qualities desired in the beer, tasting like water is good, right?\r\n\r\nThere was absolutely nothing remarkable about this beer other than its price, which, especially for Michigan residents used to a higher alcohol tax, seems ludicrously low.  There's a place and time for cheap beer, and if you really want to put the emphasis on cheap, you can't really go wrong with Bürger Light.  I certainly wouldn't drink it as my first, second or third beer of the night, but it's not a horrible option to have just to have something to drink while watching a game.\r\n\r\nBürger Light is available throughout Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana at $2.99 for a six pack and $5.99 for a twelve pack.

These flowers are harvested once a year in late summer. Since hops lose their bitterness easily, most often, they are ground up, dried, and frozen, until they are sent off to be put in beer. Often, especially for the homebrewer, the ground up hops are made into small 'plugs' or 'pellets' as seen below.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_82\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"250\" caption=\"Paul holding a small bag of hop pellets.\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-82\" title=\"hops\" src=\"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/06\/hops.jpg\" alt=\"Paul holding a small bag of hop pellets.\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" \/>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAs many people know, hops are what give beer a bitter flavor or aroma.

{"ID":"93","post_author":"4","post_date":"2009-07-31 13:33:56","post_date_gmt":"2009-07-31 20:33:56","post_content":"Bottled beer has been around since the 1500s. Before that, the only real way to get your beer was straight from the barrel. Now, the most common way for you or I to have a beer at home is for us to buy a six-pack. So, how is beer bottled? What gives it the carbonation? Why are some beers more carbonated than others?\r\n\r\nThere are two major ways for a bottle of beer to have carbonation in it. The first, and original, way for beer to be carbonated was the beer was to be sealed in bottles before the fermentation was finished. When fermentation occurs, it releases CO2. Airlocks in fermentation tanks release this CO2.If the tank is sealed, the CO2 has nowhere to go, and therefore stays in the liquid. Since bottles are airtight, the it continues to ferment, carbonating the bottle of beer.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is more difficult to do than it sounds, since bottling the beer too early in the fermenting process could easily result in the bottles becoming too carbonated, and burst the bottle. This resulted in a modified method of bottling beers. The modern method is to 'prime' the bottles. In non-filtered beers, yeast is still present in the bottles. Therefore, just before bottling, priming sugar mixed with water is added to the fermented beer. This allows for a more controlled amount of sugar to be present in the bottle before it's fermented inside the bottle.\r\n\r\nIn modern mass-produced beers, bottling is very different. Since most mass-produced beer is filtered, and therefore, lacks yeast to ferment inside the bottle, the carbonation is more directly added. The bottling company simple adds CO2 inside the bottles and the gas enters the liquid.\r\n\r\nSome beers, notably Guinness, and other similar beers, like Tetley's, use Nitrogen for most of their pressurization. The nitrogen is less soluble than the CO2. This means that the beer can be pressurized higher with less 'fizzyness'. This is why, when you drink it, nitrogenated beers taste so smooth. The bubbles of nitrogen form very small bubbles compared to CO2, leading to a creamy head.\r\n\r\n","post_title":"Bare-Bones Basics #3: Bottling","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"bare-bones-basics-3-bottling","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2009-07-31 13:33:56","post_modified_gmt":"2009-07-31 20:33:56","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/?p=93","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

(Now, you can synthesize ethanol, industrially, through the hydration of ethylene, but this involves using some nasty chemicals that don't belong in something you plan on drinking.) Yeast, as you probably know, eats sugars in your beer and (as Tim likes to put it) poop out alcohol.\r\n\r\nYeast is a single-cell fungus, which is found just about everywhere. All types of yeast reproduce asexually, though there is a process of genetic material exchange between cells. The yeast species you are probably most familier with is <em>saccharomyces cerevisiae<\/em>, ale yeast. This is actually the same specie as baking yeast, but in general, brewers use a less aggressive yeast strain that produces fewer unwanted chemicals that would give the beer an undesireable taste.<em> Saccharomyces carlsbergenis<\/em>, called so because it was first isolated by Carlsberg, also known as <em>saccharomyces pastorianus<\/em> or lager yeast, is, unshockingly, used in lagers. Saccharomyces carlsbergenis is a combination of saccharomyces cerevisiae and a third type of yeast, used mostly in wine and ciders, saccharomyces bayanus.\r\n\r\nThe thing most important for your beer that you need to know about the differences in these yeasts is that lager yeast generally has higher attenuation, meaning it can eat more sugars, leaving your beer more dry (though the variation in strains of each lager and ale yeast provides a large overlap), and that it works at a colder temperature (about 10-15 F colder) than ale yeast.\r\n\r\nAll alcohol-producing yeast can work in two different ways, based on if there is oxygen around or not. When yeast eats sugars without oxygen, the yeast gives off the waste of ethanol, and carbon dioxide, along with some energy. This energy does two things, it powers the yeast cell, so it can grow, and warms the liquid it is in. When there is oxygen present, the yeast cell can completely break down the sugar into water and carbon dioxide. This produces significanly more energy for the yeast cell, which lets it grow much faster.\r\n\r\nWhen you add your yeast to your wort, you want some oxygen to rapidly grow your yeast so fermentation doesn't take a long time. Once the yeast has consumed all the oxygen in the wort, it then switches to anarobic fermentation (without oxygen) and makes ethanol. If you have a large quantity of yeast cells to start with, you don't have to oxygenate your wort as much, and you'll get higher alcohol concentrations (and less water) in your beer.\r\n\r\nAnother stat you may see on the side of your yeast pack is 'flocculation'. Flocculation means the 'clumping' of yeast cells in your beer. This sounds like it might be a bad thing, but actually it's good. When your yeast cells are done eating sugars, they can do one of two things: with yeast that has a low flocculation, it will just sit suspended in the beer. High flocculation means the cells will clump together and float to the top, in the case of ale yeast, or sink to the bottom, in the case of lager yeast. This will make your beer clearer. Some beer styles are traditionally cloudy with yeast, and has a slightly different taste because of it.\r\n\r\nSome of you may notice I didn't mention <em>brettanomyces<\/em>, a genus of yeast used in making lambics. This yeast is naturally found in the air in the southwest of Belgium. Lambics are made, not by adding yeast directly to the wort, but by allowing them open access to the air. The yeast particles in the air fall into the beer, instead of physically putting a yeast solution into the beer. This yeast gives lambics a distinctive sour taste. This open fermentation, you might think, wouldn't work, because it isn't separated from the air. If the wort is exposed to the air, it will have access to oxygen, and the yeast would never anaerobicly ferment the sugars into ethanol. However, if you remember part of what is released is carbon dioxide. CO2 is heavier than air and sits on top of the wort, creating a barrier between the oxygen in the air and the wort, allowing fermentation.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"315\" caption=\"White Lab Varieties\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.weekendbrewer.com\/images\/whitelabs.jpg\"><img class=\" \" title=\"White Lab Varieties\" src=\"http:\/\/www.weekendbrewer.com\/images\/whitelabs.jpg\" alt=\"White Lab Varieties\" width=\"315\" height=\"234\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThere are many different strains of each of these species of yeast. Each have slightly different characteristics that will produce slightly different results. More or less flocculation, more or less attenuation, higher or lower prefered fermentation temperatures, etc. These allow you to fine tune your beer, in a general sense, the important distinguishing factor is ale yeast, lager yeast, or lambic yeast. This hopefully helps you understand how yeast works, and gives you a better idea as to what is happening inside your carboy.","post_title":"Bare-Bones Basics #5: Yeast","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"bare-bones-basics-5-yeast","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-10-29 10:20:51","post_modified_gmt":"2010-10-29 14:20:51","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/?p=94","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

It was included as part of a beginner's brewing kit by a local store - and it definitely is not a beginner's brewing book.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say it's difficult to read, or even to understand, but it isn't organized as a step-by-step process to completing your first brew, and then advancing from there. Though Papzian hits basics at various points in the book, a general understanding of how to brew a batch of beer is probably required unless you want to read the whole book multiple times before you can even get started. Each section covers a different aspect of the brewing process, and does so from the basics to some of the more advanced homebrewing techniques within that category.\r\n\r\nStill, some of the organization issues persist even when the reader has a better understanding of the brewing process. Tangents abound, and sometimes there's an abrupt change of subject that even this now-experienced (this was the first brewing book I read, but that was over a year and 20-some batches ago) finds tedious, or even scatterbrained. And scatterbrained might be an important part of the Cult of Personality that Papazian has built his homebrewing reputation upon. Still, too often \"I could continue explaining this to you, but wouldn't you rather be drinking?\" is dropped, when the reader is obviously interested in finding out the details - hence picking up a brewing book, dude.\r\n\r\nThe final hundred pages or so contain recipes for various brews that Papazian has crafted over the years, often with creative nicknames (\"dfhdgh\" is one of my favorites). Those recipes are reference points more than anything for advanced brewers, though, continuing with the theme of Papazian not picking out an audience (experienced or beginner) and sticking to it. There are very few all-grain recipes, a source of frustration for those who are branching out a bit.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, this book is a fun read, a relatively easy read, but certainly not an essential one. Don't pick it up if you're trying to learn how to brew for the first time - go with one of Papazian's other offerings. Don't pick it up if you're trying to take your brewing to serious new levels (though his breakdown of various all-grain mashing techniques is very good), either. However, as part of a more complete brewing library, or just as a fun read about homebrewing, it's worthwhile.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in purchasing, do so through this Amazon affiliate link: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0060584734?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=yeasanddown-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060584734\">The Homebrewer's Companion<\/a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=yeasanddown-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0060584734\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" \/>","post_title":" Book Review: The Homebrewer's Companion","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"book-review-the-homebrewers-companion","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-01-31 08:49:05","post_modified_gmt":"2011-01-31 13:49:05","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/?p=109","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

Before that, the only real way to get your beer was straight from the barrel. Now, the most common way for you or I to have a beer at home is for us to buy a six-pack. So, how is beer bottled? What gives it the carbonation? Why are some beers more carbonated than others?\n\nThere are two major ways for a bottle of beer to have carbonation in it. The first, and original, way for beer to be carbonated was the beer was to be sealed in bottles before the fermentation was finished. When fermentation occurs, it releases CO2. Airlocks in fermentation tanks release this CO2.If the tank is sealed, the CO2 has nowhere to go, and therefore stays in the liquid. Since bottles are airtight, the it continues to ferment, carbonating the bottle of beer.\n\nHowever, this is more difficult to do than it sounds, since bottling the beer too early in the fermenting process could easily result in the bottles becoming too carbonated, and burst the bottle. This resulted in a modified method of bottling beers. The modern method is to 'prime' the bottles. In non-filtered beers, yeast is still present in the bottles. Therefore, just before bottling, priming sugar mixed with water is added to the fermented beer. This allows for a more controlled amount of sugar to present in the bottle before it's fermented inside the bottle.\n\nIn modern mass produced beers, bottling is very different. Since most mass produced beer is filtered, and therefore, lacks yeast to ferment inside the bottle,","post_title":"Bare-Bones Basics #3: Bottling","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"93-revision","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2009-06-15 15:46:18","post_modified_gmt":"2009-06-15 22:46:18","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"93","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/2009\/06\/93-revision\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

On my first sip, I actually thought the malt might be a bit stronger than I would like. Then I get a lingering bitterness that coats the mouth, and balances out the future sips.

{"ID":"137","post_author":"4","post_date":"2009-07-31 13:33:01","post_date_gmt":"2009-07-31 20:33:01","post_content":"Bottled beer has been around since the 1500s. Before that, the only real way to get your beer was straight from the barrel. Now, the most common way for you or I to have a beer at home is for us to buy a six-pack. So, how is beer bottled? What gives it the carbonation? Why are some beers more carbonated than others?\n\nThere are two major ways for a bottle of beer to have carbonation in it. The first, and original, way for beer to be carbonated was the beer was to be sealed in bottles before the fermentation was finished. When fermentation occurs, it releases CO2. Airlocks in fermentation tanks release this CO2.If the tank is sealed, the CO2 has nowhere to go, and therefore stays in the liquid. Since bottles are airtight, the it continues to ferment, carbonating the bottle of beer.\n\nHowever, this is more difficult to do than it sounds, since bottling the beer too early in the fermenting process could easily result in the bottles becoming too carbonated, and burst the bottle. This resulted in a modified method of bottling beers. The modern method is to 'prime' the bottles. In non-filtered beers, yeast is still present in the bottles. Therefore, just before bottling, priming sugar mixed with water is added to the fermented beer. This allows for a more controlled amount of sugar to be present in the bottle before it's fermented inside the bottle.\n\nIn modern mass-produced beers, bottling is very different. Since most mass-produced beer is filtered, and therefore, lacks yeast to ferment inside the bottle, the carbonation is more directly added. The bottling company simple adds CO2 inside the bottles and the gas enters the liquid.\n\nSome beers, notably Guinness, and other similar beers, like Tetley's, use Nitrogen for most of their pressurization. The nitrogen is less soluble than the CO2. This means that the beer can be pressurized higher with less 'fizzyness'. This is why, when you drink it, nitrogenated beers taste so smooth. The bubbles of nitrogen form very small bubbles compared to CO2, leading to a creamy head.\n\n","post_title":"Bare-Bones Basics #3: Bottling","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"93-revision-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2009-07-31 13:33:01","post_modified_gmt":"2009-07-31 20:33:01","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"93","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/2009\/07\/93-revision-2\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

There was a $15 charge to enter, along with beers priced at $4, $6, and $12 for a 14-ounce cup.

Sure, the cover was to offset the costs of closing the street, etc., but much of that seemed so unnecessary to me.

The food, from area restaurants, was also more expensive than one would expect.\n\nFood\nThe Cottage Bar, Sami's Gyro, and Maggie's Kitchen were the food options. The options were good enough, with the American, Greek, and Mexican cuisine, respectively. I went with a gyro from Sami's and (as mentioned above), it was more expensive than it typically is if you order one in the restaurant. The setup was also subpar here, as there were no defined lines for people to wait in, and the tents seemed to be situated right in the way of an area most people wanted to walk through.\n\nBeer\nThe beer selections were... lacking. On top of costing more than they typically do, there were fewer options available than one would see simply walking into Founders on an average night. The distribution was done by purchasing $2 tickets, which you exchanged 2-3 of for a beer (or half beer, for the rotating taps). The tent was set up as a free-for all, which was actually pretty cool, not to mention the multi-taps - which were on the sides of Airstream-style trailers.. When I first arrive, I though that the taking of tickets might be done a little... inconsistently, and they wouldn't really care to make sure that every beer was paid for in full (a la the winter beer festival from the Michigan Brewer's Guild). This was not the case, meaning that it was just really expensive beer.\n\nMusic\nThe local bands that played were standard-to-good examples of a local music scene, though I had never heard of any of them. There were some eclectic jams - but I guess that worked out fine for much of the clientele of the Fest. As bands were tearing down or setting up for their sets, a hippie drum band, which seemed to be composed mainly of Founders employees, played on the front porch of the building. It made the whole thing feel rather Ann Arboreal - and that's not a good thing. Hippie drum circles suck.\n\nOverview\nThis event is great in theory, but the planners need to pay a keener attention to the details of making sure it's set up to operate more smoothly in future years. The physical layout and pricing options were the most egregious parts. Like many bars, the problem was primarily that the purveyors weren't thinking about the setup through the eyes of the consumer, and therefore set it up illogically in certain aspects.

Sad news for yours truly, who's fantasies included a small house in Denver within walking distance from said brewery, but alas, it was not meant to be. However, the transition to their Maryland facility was allowed Flying Dog consolidate to a more high tech and efficient facility.  The move was in reponse to increased hop and malt prices, in addition to the loss of several contract brewing jobs.\r\n\r\nNow, none of this is going to hinder the ability to get yourself some Flying Dog beer. In fact, I've noticed a marked increase in tap houses carrying various Flying Dog brews. The place where I go when I want to get a non-local beer, now carries the Flying Dog Imperial Porter on draft regularly, and it is becoming one of my favorite drafts around.\r\n\r\nThe Gonzo Imperial Porter is a tribute beer to Hunter S. Thompson, as many of you know or could have guessed.

The majority of these changes were on the basis of ingredient availability.\n\nWhereas last time, we used habanero peppers for heat and chipotle peppers to give a smoky flavor, the grocery store, unfortunately, was out of habaneros when I went to acquire ingredients to make another batch of our (outstanding) recipe. Instead, I picked up the peppers with the highest <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scoville_scale\">Scoville rating<\/a> out of what the store had available, eventually settling on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tradewindsfruit.com\/hot_peppers.htm\">serrano huasteco<\/a>. Unfortunately, they're only 1\/10th as hot as habaneros.\n\nSo, with the same number of chipotles, but replacing habaneros with serranos, to secondary we went. After a few days, we still weren't getting the heat we wanted (oh, the glory of a spigoted ale pail), so it was back to the grocery store to purchase habaneros. We threw a couple of those bad boys in, and then waited a week or so.\n\nEventually, we tested again, and the beer had plenty of heat, but not the smoky flavor we wanted. Using a slotted spoon, we scooped out most of the hot peppers, but left the chipotles. I kegged five days later...\n\nTasting Notes\n\nThis edition is much hotter than the first, primarily since the peppers stayed in secondary longer. Whereas batch #1 would sneak up on you after a couple sips, this one isn't hiding any heat. It also has a different flavor mix, with a bit more earthiness (from the serranos) to go along with the heat. Alas, the chipotle smokiness is covered up by the other things.\n\nIf we were to make this beer again (something I think is probably pretty likely), I would prefer to make it from the original recipe, with an emphasis on the smoky flavors, and just enough heat to complement that.

There are many ways to homebrew, but here is a nice primer to get yourself started. Better\/bigger equipment can make your job easier\/make your beer better, but I'll discuss a fairly standard 5 gallon setup.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Brew Pot<\/strong>\r\nThis should be at least 3 gallons, and the bigger the better. Ideally, you are putting 100% of the liquid you are using in your beer in your boil, but if need be, you can get away with adding additional water later. You may have a 3 gallon pot already, if not, a 5 gallon pot will cost about $30-$40.\r\nSidenote: when boiling this much water, a top for your brew pot is essentially a requirement, you don't want to be sitting around for 5 hours waiting for your water to boil.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Fermenting Vessel<\/strong>\r\nThis can be a carboy, or just a plastic pail or jug. The important thing is that it is airtight and can be affixed with an airlock (see below). In general it's nice to have this all in one container, but in a pinch, you could setup several milk jugs with airlocks and save yourself a bit of coin, but a 6.5 gallon pale with an airtight top and a purpose built hole for an airlock can be purchased for $15-$20. A similar sized carboy will go for about $40-$50.\r\nSidenote: For about $5 more, the 6.5 gallon pale can have a spigot, which VERY handling during bottling. Unless you're a master syphoner, you should seriously consider going with the spigoted pale.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Airlock<\/strong>\r\nYeast doesn't produce alcohol in the presence of oxygen. It has to consume all of the oxygen in the fermentation vessel before it can start making little -OH groups attached our friend, the ethyl group. It also needs to be able to release the CO2 that's produced. Otherwise, your beer will begin to carbonate before you want it to. These cost very little, about $2-$3. When making a particularly large batch or one that is likely to ferment a great deal, people occasionally use a blowoff instead of an airlock. They simply affix a plastic hose to the top of the fermentation vessel, and put the other end of the hose in a bowl of sanitizer.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Bottles<\/strong>\r\nAfter you've fermented your beer, you need someplace to put it. Some people have kegging kits, but those cost more than $100. The easiest way to do it is with used bottles of beer. The easy, but expensive way to do this is with bottles with Grolsh style tops. These are a breeze. All you need to do is put the beer in the bottle, snap it shut, and wait. If you don't have a ton of money to spend $4 for a bottle, the more economical method is the traditional bottles. Supposedly, you can use twist-off topped bottles with out issue, but I recommend sticking with standard topped bottles. You'll need a bottle capper. Basic ones will cost about $15, and nicer ones go up to about $35. Collecting bottles is something you should be doing on a regular basis. Offer to give your friends a couple of beers if they supply you with their bottles. Also: CLEAN YOU BOTTLES IMMEDIATELY. As soon as you're done, rinse your bottles out. It's a pain (and really gross) to try to clean out mold in the bottom of bottles. They don't need to be sanitized yet, but as soon as you get them, rinse them.\r\nNot-So-Pro Tip: Only use brown bottles. Beer in bottles of other colors will be ruined in less than 30 seconds when exposed to sunlight, and can be just as skunked from everyday indoor lighting if exposed to it for too long.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Syphon<\/strong>: Depending on your setup, it's <em>possible<\/em> to do this without a syphon, but I wouldn't recommend it. When you're done with primary fermentation, and you're getting ready to bottle, you'll want to remove the beer from your fermentation vessel, add priming sugar, and then add your beer to the bottles. Taking it out of the primary fermentation vessel first will eliminate a lot of the sediments you won't want in your beer (trub). Technically you don't NEED this, but it costs so little, you might as well. Pouring the beer won't keep this stuff out, so a syphon is the way to go. This can be had for a couple bucks tops. We have an auto-syphon which is a huge boon. It includes a pump that basically requires you to have no skill at syphoning (something that has been evident after several failures at syphoning the 'real' way. Auto-syphons will cost about $10.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Sanitizer<\/strong>\r\nStaying sanitary is huge. If you get the wrong kind of bacteria in your beer you can die. Now that's a worst case scenario, but at the very least, it'll add bad flavors to your beer. It also isn't really measurable, it's not really practical to test your beer for contamination before it's done, so it's important for the sake of your beer that you stay as sanitary as possible, using sanitizer on anything that's going to come in contact with the beer\/wort. You can get away without sanitizing something if it's going to be in contact with something yet to be boiled, but in general, sanitize everything. One-step sanitizer works the best, as you don't have to rinse it out afterwards, works fast, etc., but bleach can do in a pinch, and is very very cheap.\r\n\r\nNow, there are many homebrew stores that will offer many of these items in a kit. However, the kit we purchased as around $100, and did not include a brew pot or a pale for bottling (it did include a 6.5 gallon carboy). If you know what you're looking for, and are willing to shop around, especially online, you can achieve a better setup than what we started with for less.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other, less necessary items that you might find useful, in order from least to most expensive:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Bottle Brush - to clean your carboy (if you're using one), without it, cleaning a carboy is a very difficult process<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Food thermometer - to know when it is safe to add your yeast, also necessary for mashing<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Hydrometer - to measure original and final gravity (to know when fermentation is finished, and the ABV of your beer)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Second fermentation vessel (clear) - for secondary fermentation<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Mash tun - for mashing  malted grains, greatly decreasing your per batch costs<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Kegging kit - for storing your beer and hastening your carbonation times<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf you're going with a carboy, buy the bottling brush as well. It'll be uniquely shaped to help you scrub the insides of the glass, allowing your next batch to be assuredly clean.\r\n\r\nI didn't include any 'ingredients' in this post as we plan on having separate articles on each of those. However, with the above setup, you should be able to purchase a 'kit' from a brewing store that will have all of your ingredients you'll need, generally: malted extract, hops, yeast, and priming sugar, as well as instructions as to how to brew the particular beer that your kit is for.\r\n\r\nSo here's the setup I recommend for a starting homebrewer:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>5 gallon brewpot - $35<\/li>\r\n\t<li>2 fermentation pales (1 spigoted) - $35<\/li>\r\n\t<li>auto-syphon - $10<\/li>\r\n\t<li>airlock - $2<\/li>\r\n\t<li>sanitizer - $5<\/li>\r\n\t<li>bottle capper\/caps - $15<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nTotal price: ~ $105\r\n\r\nAll you'll need then is to get some bottles from friends, and your should be set for making 5 gallon batches.","post_title":"Getting Started: How what do you NEED to homebrew?","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"getting-started-how-what-do-you-need-to-homebrew","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-05-05 08:58:27","post_modified_gmt":"2010-05-05 15:58:27","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/?p=172","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

They provide the sugar for fermentation, a great deal of the flavor, enzymes to help the yeast break down difficult-to-digest sugars, and almost solely are responsible for the texture of a beer. In short, grains are to beer as grapes are to wine (suck it, Jim Koch).\r\n\r\nThe sugars in harvested grains are not readily useable by yeast. They start as starches, which are long strings of sugar molecules in a chain. Yeast can't work it's magic on these so they must first be broken up. Fortunately, this can be done by a process called \"malting\". Basically, to malt a grain, you let it start to grow (germinate, for the botany-inclined) by soaking it in water. The germination process releases enzymes that break down the starches into sugars. It is then, in a controlled fashion, heated (kilned) to stop the germination. The amount of kilning affects the grain's flavor and color.\r\n\r\nThe most common grain used in beer (and the only one allowed in Germany while still called 'beer') is barley. Barley used in brewing comes in various strains, each of which are processed in any number of ways, allowing for a wide range of options for ways to change your beer. In a general sense, most barley grains fall into two categories: Two-row and Six-row. Two-row is the traditional barley strain used in most European beers. Six-row is more common in American beers and has been bred to have higher enzyme content that will help break down more complex sugars in adjuncts added to the beer.\r\n\r\nWheat is used often in certain styles of beers (the over-arching category would be aptly named 'wheat beers'). Germany and Belgium are most known for their various styles of beers featuring wheat. Wheat malts can not be used as 100% of your grain bill as they lack enough of the enzymes needed, and therefore should be used in conjunction with barley. Wheat also adds a noticeable haze to beer.\r\n\r\nOther grains, such as oats, rye, even potatoes can be used to add fermentable sugars, too, but are more rare. We'll try to do a beer and post about these on an individual basis.","post_title":"Bare-Bones Basics #4: Grains","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"bare-bones-basics-4-grains","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-09-21 14:57:21","post_modified_gmt":"2010-09-21 18:57:21","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/?p=175","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

{"ID":"217","post_author":"4","post_date":"2010-05-05 08:56:08","post_date_gmt":"2010-05-05 15:56:08","post_content":"I'm going to go through what exactly you'll need to set yourself up to homebrew. There are many ways to homebrew, but here is a nice primer to get yourself started. Better\/bigger equipment can make your job easier\/make your beer better, but I'll discuss a fairly standard 5 gallon setup.\n\n1. Brew Pot\nThis should be at least 3 gallons, and the bigger the better. Ideally, you are putting 100% of the liquid you are using in your beer in your boil, but if need be, you can get away with adding additional water later. You may have a 3 gallon pot already, if not, a 5 gallon pot will cost about $30-$40.\nSidenote: when boiling this much water, a top for your brew pot is essentially a requirement, you don't want to be sitting around for 5 hours waiting for your water to boil.\n\n2. Fermenting Vessel\nThis can be a carboy, or just a plastic pail or jug. The important thing is that it is airtight and can be affixed with an airlock (see below). In general it's nice to have this all in one container, but in a pinch, you could setup several milk jugs with airlocks and save yourself a bit of coin, but a 6.5 gallon pale with an airtight top and a purpose built hole for an airlock can be purchased for $15-$20. A similar sized carboy will go for about $40-$50.\nSidenote: For about $5 more, the 6.5 gallon pale can have a spigot, which VERY handling during bottling. Unless you're a master syphoner, you should seriously consider going with the spigoted pale.\n\n3. Airlock\nYeast doesn't produce alcohol in the presence of oxygen. It has to consume all of the oxygen in the fermentation vessel before it can start making little -OH groups attached our friend, the ethyl group. It also needs to be able to release the CO2 that's produced. Otherwise, your beer will begin to carbonate before you want it to. These cost very little, about $2-$3. When making a particularly large batch or one that is likely to ferment a great deal, people occasionally use a blowoff instead of an airlock. They simply affix a plastic hose to the top of the fermentation vessel, and put the other end of the hose in a bowl of sanitizer.\n\n4. Bottles\nAfter you've fermented your beer, you need someplace to put it. Some people have kegging kits, but those cost more than $100. The easiest way to do it is with used bottles of beer. The easy, but expensive way to do this is with bottles with Grolsh style tops. These are a breeze. All you need to do is put the beer in the bottle, snap it shut, and wait. If you don't have a ton of money to spend $4 for a bottle, the more economical method is the traditional bottles. Supposedly, you can use twist-off topped bottles with out issue, but I recommend sticking with standard topped bottles. You'll need a bottle capper. Basic ones will cost about $15, and nicer ones go up to about $35. Collecting bottles is something you should be doing on a regular basis. Offer to give your friends a couple of beers if they supply you with their bottles. Also: CLEAN YOU BOTTLES IMMEDIATELY. As soon as you're done, rinse your bottles out. It's a pain (and really gross) to try to clean out mold in the bottom of bottles. They don't need to be sanitized yet, but as soon as you get them, rinse them.\nNot-So-Pro Tip: Only use brown bottles. Beer in bottles of other colors will be ruined in less than 30 seconds when exposed to sunlight, and can be just as skunked from everyday indoor lighting if exposed to it for too long.\n\n5. Syphon: Depending on your setup, it's <em>possible<\/em> to do this without a syphon, but I wouldn't recommend it. When you're done with primary fermentation, and you're getting ready to bottle, you'll want to remove the beer from your fermentation vessel, add priming sugar, and then add your beer to the bottles. Taking it out of the primary fermentation vessel first will eliminate a lot of the sediments you won't want in your beer (trub). Technically you don't NEED this, but it costs so little, you might as well. Pouring the beer won't keep this stuff out, so a syphon is the way to go. This can be had for a couple bucks tops. We have an auto-syphon which is a huge boon. It includes a pump that basically requires you to have no skill at syphoning (something that has been evident after several failures at syphoning the 'real' way. Auto-syphons will cost about $10.\n\n6. Sanitizer\nStaying sanitary is huge. If you get the wrong kind of bacteria in your beer you can die. Now that's a worst case scenario, but at the very least, it'll add bad flavors to your beer. It also isn't really measurable, it's not really practical to test your beer for contamination before it's done, so it's important for the sake of your beer that you stay as sanitary as possible, using sanitizer on anything that's going to come in contact with the beer\/wort. You can get away without sanitizing something if it's going to be in contact with something yet to be boiled, but in general, sanitize everything. One-step sanitizer works the best, as you don't have to rinse it out afterwards, works fast, etc., but bleach can do in a pinch, and is very very cheap.\n\nNow, there are many homebrew stores that will offer many of these items in a kit. However, the kit we purchased as around $100, and did not include a brew pot or a pale for bottling (it did include a 6.5 gallon carboy). If you know what you're looking for, and are willing to shop around, especially online, you can achieve a better setup than what we started with for less.\n\nThere are a few other, less necessary items that you might find useful, in order from least to most expensive:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Bottle Brush - to clean your carboy (if you're using one), without it, cleaning a carboy is a very difficult process<\/li>\n\t<li>Food thermometer - to know when it is safe to add your yeast, also necessary for mashing<\/li>\n\t<li>Hydrometer - to measure original and final gravity (to know when fermentation is finished, and the ABV of your beer)<\/li>\n\t<li>Second fermentation vessel (clear) - for secondary fermentation<\/li>\n\t<li>Mash tun - for mashing  malted grains, greatly decreasing your per batch costs<\/li>\n\t<li>Kegging kit - for storing your beer and hastening your carbonation times<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nIf you're going with a carboy, buy the bottling brush as well. It'll be uniquely shaped to help you scrub the insides of the glass, allowing your next batch to be assuredly clean.\n\nI didn't include any 'ingredients' in this post as we plan on having separate articles on each of those. However, with the above setup, you should be able to purchase a 'kit' from a brewing store that will have all of your ingredients you'll need, generally: malted extract, hops, yeast, and priming sugar, as well as instructions as to how to brew the particular beer that your kit is for.\n\nSo here's the setup I recommend for a starting homebrewer:\n<ul>\n\t<li>5 gallon brewpot - $35<\/li>\n\t<li>2 fermentation pales (1 spigoted) - $35<\/li>\n\t<li>auto-syphon - $10<\/li>\n\t<li>airlock - $2<\/li>\n\t<li>sanitizer - $5<\/li>\n\t<li>bottle capper\/caps - $15<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nTotal price: ~ $105\n\nAll you'll need then is to get some bottles from friends, and your setu","post_title":"Getting Started: How what do you NEED to homebrew?","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"172-revision-3","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-05-05 08:56:08","post_modified_gmt":"2010-05-05 15:56:08","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"172","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/2010\/05\/172-revision-3\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

It's a pain (and really gross) to try to clean out mold in the bottom of bottles. They don't need to be sanitized yet, but as soon as you get them, rinse them.\r\nNot-So-Pro Tip: Only use brown bottles. Beer in bottles of other colors will be ruined in less than 30 seconds when exposed to sunlight, and can be just as skunked from everyday indoor lighting if exposed to it for too long.\r\n\r\n5. Syphon: Depending on your setup, it's <em>possible<\/em> to do this without a syphon, but I wouldn't recommend it. When you're done with primary fermentation, and you're getting ready to bottle, you'll want to remove the beer from your fermentation vessel, add priming sugar, and then add your beer to the bottles. Taking it out of the primary fermentation vessel first will eliminate a lot of the sediments you won't want in your beer (trub). Technically you don't NEED this, but it costs so little, you might as well. Pouring the beer won't keep this stuff out, so a syphon is the way to go. This can be had for a couple bucks tops. We have an auto-syphon which is a huge boon. It includes a pump that basically requires you to have no skill at syphoning (something that has been evident after several failures at syphoning the 'real' way. Auto-syphons will cost about $10.\r\n\r\n6. Sanitizer\r\nStaying sanitary is huge. If you get the wrong kind of bacteria in your beer you can die. Now that's a worst case scenario, but at the very least, it'll add bad flavors to your beer. It also isn't really measurable, it's not really practical to test your beer for contamination before it's done, so it's important for the sake of your beer that you stay as sanitary as possible, using sanitizer on anything that's going to come in contact with the beer\/wort. You can get away without sanitizing something if it's going to be in contact with something yet to be boiled, but in general, sanitize everything. One-step sanitizer works the best, as you don't have to rinse it out afterwards, works fast, etc., but bleach can do in a pinch, and is very very cheap.\r\n\r\nNow, there are many homebrew stores that will offer many of these items in a kit. However, the kit we purchased as around $100, and did not include a brew pot or a pale for bottling (it did include a 6.5 gallon carboy). If you know what you're looking for, and are willing to shop around, especially online, you can achieve a better setup than what we started with for less.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other, less necessary items that you might find useful, in order from least to most expensive:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Bottle Brush - to clean your carboy (if you're using one), without it, cleaning a carboy is a very difficult process<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Food thermometer - to know when it is safe to add your yeast, also necessary for mashing<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Hydrometer - to measure original and final gravity (to know when fermentation is finished, and the ABV of your beer)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Second fermentation vessel (clear) - for secondary fermentation<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Mash tun - for mashing  malted grains, greatly decreasing your per batch costs<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Kegging kit - for storing your beer and hastening your carbonation times<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf you're going with a carboy, buy the bottling brush as well. It'll be uniquely shaped to help you scrub the insides of the glass, allowing your next batch to be assuredly clean.\r\n\r\nI didn't include any 'ingredients' in this post as we plan on having separate articles on each of those. However, with the above setup, you should be able to purchase a 'kit' from a brewing store that will have all of your ingredients you'll need, generally: malted extract, hops, yeast, and priming sugar, as well as instructions as to how to brew the particular beer that your kit is for.\r\n\r\nSo here's the setup I recommend for a starting homebrewer:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>5 gallon brewpot - $35<\/li>\r\n\t<li>2 fermentation pales (1 spigoted) - $35<\/li>\r\n\t<li>auto-syphon - $10<\/li>\r\n\t<li>airlock - $2<\/li>\r\n\t<li>sanitizer - $5<\/li>\r\n\t<li>bottle capper\/caps - $15<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nTotal price: ~ $105\r\n\r\nAll you'll need then is to get some bottles from friends, and your should be set for making 5 gallon batches.","post_title":"Getting Started: How what do you NEED to homebrew?","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"172-revision-4","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-05-05 08:56:51","post_modified_gmt":"2010-05-05 15:56:51","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"172","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/2010\/05\/172-revision-4\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

It was included as part of a beginner's brewing kit by a local store - and it definitely is not a beginner's brewing book.\n\nThat's not to say it's difficult to read, or even to understand, but it isn't organized as a step-by-step process to completing your first brew, and then advancing from there. Though Papzian hits basics at various points in the book, a general understanding of how to brew a batch of beer is probably required unless you want to read the whole book multiple times before you can even get started. Each section covers a different aspect of the brewing process, and does so from the basics to some of the more advanced homebrewing techniques within that category.\n\nStill, some of the organization issues persist even when the reader has a better understanding of the brewing process. Tangents abound, and sometimes there's an abrupt change of subject that even this now-experienced (this was the first brewing book I read, but that was over a year and 20-some batches ago) finds tedious, or even scatterbrained. And scatterbrained might be an important part of the Cult of Personality that Papazian has built his homebrewing reputation upon. Still, too often \"I could continue explaining this to you, but wouldn't you rather be drinking?\" is dropped, when the reader is obviously interested in finding out the details - hence picking up a brewing book, dude.\n\nThe final hundred pages or so contain recipes for various brews that Papazian has crafted over the years, often with creative nicknames (\"dfhdgh\" is one of my favorites). Those recipes are reference points more than anything for advanced brewers, though, continuing with the theme of Papazian not picking out an audience (experienced or beginner) and sticking to it. There are very few all-grain recipes, a source of frustration for those who are branching out a bit.\n\nAt the end of the day, this book is a fun read, a relatively easy read, but certainly not an essential one. Don't pick it up if you're trying to learn how to brew for the first time. Don't pick it up if you're trying to take your brewing to serious new levels (though his breakdown of various all-grain mashing techniques is very good), either.

I couldn't walk long distances on account of a badly sprained ankle, so it seemed like a great a opportunity to drive out to a brewpub in the surrounding area.\n\nWe decided to head two towns over to Milan, MI and check out <a href=\"http:\/\/ogbrewing.com\/\">Original Gravity Brewing Company<\/a>. It's just off the road in an unassuming building that used to be an auto garage. The first thing you notice as you walk in is the brewing equipment set in the far corner of the space. Most places separate their brewing area from their dining area, but OG decided to incorporate it with the bar surrounding one side and a low fence surrounding the other. Immediately upon walking in, you get the impression that this place is about beer.\n\nThere are quite a few round wooden tables with heavy wooden chairs set in two separate sections, but Tim and I decided to sidle up to the bar. The bar itself is impressive. It is very wide and made out of heavy, dark wood. From the look of the place to the ease and friendliness of the waitstaff you get the feeling the that the place has been around for a long time, yet, as the title of the post may have hinted, OG is just under 2 years old.\n\nTim and I had both tried some of their beers before (Primordial Porter for Tim, 440 Smoker for me), so we came in with some pretty high expectations. The most memorable beer for me was their Southpaw IPA. Their website describes as being hopped with copious amounts of Cascade and Amarillo hops, which I usually associate with a citrusy, almost grapefruit flavor. The hop taste in this IPA was more resiny and syrupy, which is not to say it was bad. It was a different taste in an IPA than I'd grown accustom to, and the hop taste balanced well with a fairly sweet malt base.\n\nWe'll probably be heading back to OG this Saturday for their 2 year anniversary extravaganza. There are details here, but the highlights include $2 pints until 4pm, BBQ starting at 1pm and, in a collaboration with White Labs, are showcasing the power of yeast. They are taking the same beer recipe and using different varieties of yeast to showcase the flavor profiles of different strains. All 20 beers will be on tap starting at 3pm. If you're interested in homebrewing and the subtleties therein, this is definitely an event you'll want to check out.","post_title":"Original Gravity Two Year Anniversary","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"241-autosave","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-06-10 07:54:33","post_modified_gmt":"2010-06-10 14:54:33","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"241","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/2010\/06\/241-autosave\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

From that fortuitous day in July, 2009, we've moved from extract to all-grain, started kegging, had bottle bombs and tried to ferment sweet potato. We're far from experts, but we think we have some insights that people might find valuable. We've also made mistakes that we can help others avoid and learn from as well.\n\nLike everybody who brews, we enjoy beers that others make (you might call that our first love). We try to check out any local brewpub and look for the most ridiculous beers on the menu to try. Hopefully you can find some interesting stuff as we chronicle our adventure in beer and brewing.","post_title":"About","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"2-autosave","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2012-06-22 17:43:37","post_modified_gmt":"2012-06-22 21:43:37","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"2","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/2010\/06\/2-autosave\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

After a couple brews, however, that initial excitement wears off, and it's time to step up your game. How can you move past making beer into make <em>good, interesting beer<\/em>?\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Show it off<\/strong>. If you have access to a homebrew club, this might be the most important step in improving your beer. Those who have been homebrewing for a long time can be fountains of knowledge. If something's wrong with your beer, they'll know what (and probably why). If there's a specific taste you want explained, they'll probably know what it is. If you're looking to try something new and exciting, they'll be able to tell you if it's a good idea, and how to go about doing it.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Don't use a kit<\/strong>. Even if you're still extract brewing, buy your ingredients<em> a la carte<\/em>, if possible. You can even just buy the exact items that are in a kit (and they'll probably be cheaper individually). Buying piece-by-piece will help you understand why they're in the recipe, and what purpose each ingredient serves. This also makes it much easier to change up recipes ever-so-slightly.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Try to make a clone<\/strong>. This step is especially fun, because it means you get to try a bunch of commercial beers. Find something you like, and look for a recipe online. \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/2009\/06\/review-shorts-bellaire-brown\/\">Shorts Bellaire Brown<\/a> recipe,\" for example, would be a good place to start your googling.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Go outside your comfort zone<\/strong>. This pertains to both drinking and brewing. Don't have a lot of IPAs? Try one. It might inspire you to try something new in your brewing. You can also try brewing a style that you haven't tried yet, or don't typically drink a lot of. This will help you learn more about different styles of beer, and expand your brewing horizons.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Try something crazy<\/strong>. If there's a weird flavor you want to put in a beer, or you wake up in a cold sweat with a great idea, try it out. This is how we ended up with one of our better brews, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2009\/09\/recipe-pear-shaped-charlie-weisen\/\">Charlie Pear-Shaped Weisen<\/a>. The most important part of homebrewing is having fun. You'll have fun, learn something new, and figure out what you can and can't do in the future.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nThere are many other ways to improve your brewing with simple steps. Of course, moving to all-grain (or partial-mash) brewing is a big one, but I wanted to stay simple to start it off.

First off, I found a good deal on some sweet cherries at a farmer's market, not the sour Kriek cherries that are intended for the style. Then, our local homebrew shop was all out of lambic yeasts (must be a popular style this time of year - who knew?). So, we're going to end up with some hybrid style, with a belgian style and cherry adjuncts, but probably not anything like we thought we were going to get when we started.\r\n<h3>Mash<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>10lb Belgian Pils<\/li>\r\n\t<li>1.5lb Flaked Wheat<\/li>\r\n\t<li>.5lb Caravienna<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWe mashed for a little over an hour at our standard temperatures (water temp around 170, about 150 by the time it actually mixes in with the grain) with about 4 gallons. We sparged with 165 degree water, with enough to get us up to 4.5ish total gallons. We let the water keep running out for extra wort, or a second running beer.\r\n<h3>Boil<\/h3>\r\n<h3>Fermentation<\/h3>\r\nWe had about 5 gallons of wort that we put into our carboy with a vial of <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.whitelabs.com\/beer\/strains_wlp550.html\">WLP550 Belgian Ale Yeast<\/a>. <\/strong>The extra wort (about 1 gallon) went into an Ale Pail with a bit more of the yeast <strong> <\/strong>We threw  it in our brew closet for about a week and half. It developed quite a bit of trub down on the bottom. After about 10 days, we washed and microwaved or cherries to get the sterilized and tossed them into the Ale Pail. We mashed them up as best we could with our paddle, and racked the beer from the carboy to the pail. About a week later we bottled them.\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\nThe first thing we noticed when pouring this beer was a very nice, red color, even the head was a nice pinkish cream. There was a little bit of cherry in the nose with some of the ester notes you'd expect from a belgian. The taste is actually a little thin. There isn't that much cherry flavor or belgian flavor. It is a solid tasting beer with an awesome color that finishes with a hint of the flavors we were going for. This was our first beer using fresh fruit, and, like usual, we learned some stuff. Mainly, you need to really macerate the fruit. Cherries, being a stone fruit, prevented us from using a blender or food processor, so we had to do it with a paddle. A lot of the cherries were completely whole, so didn't contribute that much flavor to the beer.","post_title":"Belgian Sour Ale, brah.","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"belgian-sour-ale-brah","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-08-20 08:05:55","post_modified_gmt":"2010-08-20 15:05:55","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/?p=256","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

We wanted those roasty, smoky flavors in the malt that would play off the smokiness of the chipotle and give the feeling of a BBQ. Tasting notes are after the recipe.\r\n<h2>Mash<\/h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>6lbs 2 Row Malt<\/li>\r\n\t<li>1lb CaraFa II<\/li>\r\n\t<li>1lb 40L Crystal<\/li>\r\n\t<li>.5lb Special Blend<\/li>\r\n\t<li>.25lb Roasted Barley (400L)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n70 minute, single infusion mash at about 155ºF\r\n<h2>Boil<\/h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>1oz EKG at 60 minutes<\/li>\r\n\t<li>3 Jalapeño Peppers washed and halved at 15 minutes<\/li>\r\n\t<li>1tsp Irish Moss at 15 Minutes<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe Jalapeños were removed after the boil, which we thought was a mistake at the time; although, the beer certainly tastes good.\r\n<h2>Fermentation<\/h2>\r\nWe used Wyeast 1056 with no started in our 6.5gal glass carboy. We added 3 halved chipotles into the carboy as well (we washed and microwaved them to kill any microbes). Our original gravity was 1.054\r\n\r\nAfter about 6 days, we racked it to secondary and added 4 more chipotles and 3 washed and halved habañeros. We tasted it multiple times a day. After 5-6 days we kegged and force carbed it.\r\n<h2>Tasting Notes<\/h2>\r\nOH MY GOSH THIS IS SO GOOD!\r\n\r\nNow that that's out of the way… It's very dark with a thick, tan head which takes its time melting away. The smell is a ton of that beautiful, smoky chipotle aroma with a bit of a heat from the habañero. The flavor is well balanced with a good, dark malt base mixing with the smoky heat of the chipotle. It finishes with a tingling heat on the back and side of your tongue. At about 4.5% it's a fairly low ABV beer for us, which is good, because I foresee myself drinking a lot of it.","post_title":"Currently Unnamed Chili Pepper Beer Recipe","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"270-revision-3","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-08-06 12:07:22","post_modified_gmt":"2010-08-06 19:07:22","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"270","guid":"http:\/\/www.panel-creations.com\/varsity_brew\/2010\/08\/270-revision-3\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The majority of these changes were on the basis of ingredient availability.\r\n\r\nWhereas last time, we used habanero peppers for heat and chipotle peppers to give a smoky flavor, the grocery store, unfortunately, was out of habaneros when I went to acquire ingredients to make another batch of our (outstanding) recipe. Instead, I picked up the peppers with the highest <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scoville_scale\">Scoville rating<\/a> out of what the store had available, eventually settling on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tradewindsfruit.com\/hot_peppers.htm\">serrano huasteco<\/a>. Unfortunately, they're only 1\/10th as hot as habaneros.\r\n\r\nSo, with the same number of chipotles, but replacing habaneros with serranos, to secondary we went. After a few days, we still weren't getting the heat we wanted (oh, the glory of a spigoted ale pail), so it was back to the grocery store to purchase habaneros. We threw a couple of those bad boys in, and then waited a week or so.\r\n\r\nEventually, we tested again, and the beer had plenty of heat, but not the smoky flavor we wanted. Using a slotted spoon, we scooped out most of the hot peppers, but left the chipotles. I kegged five days later...\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\nThis edition is much hotter than the first, primarily since the peppers stayed in secondary longer. Whereas batch #1 would sneak up on you after a couple sips, this one isn't hiding any heat. It also has a different flavor mix, with a bit more earthiness (from the serranos) to go along with the heat. Alas, the chipotle smokiness is covered up by the other things.\r\n\r\nIf we were to make this beer again (something I think is probably pretty likely), I would prefer to make it from the original recipe, with an emphasis on the smoky flavors, and just enough heat to complement that. Regardless, I'm good to relax and not worry...","post_title":"Pepper Porter v2.0","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"368-revision-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-09-08 15:02:57","post_modified_gmt":"2010-09-08 22:02:57","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"368","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/09\/368-revision-2\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

{"ID":"293","post_author":"3","post_date":"2010-08-10 15:08:29","post_date_gmt":"2010-08-10 22:08:29","post_content":"We have certainly tried a few a chili pepper beers before. The first I can remember is the Kuhnhenn Ring of Fire that jumped off the menu at The Hopcat. Since then there's been the Original Gravity Pepper Smoker, New Holland Mole Ocho and a few others. There's something really different about drinking a cold beer and feeling the capsaicin heat all throughout your body.\n\nA few weeks ago, the Michigan Brewers Guild held their Summer Beer Festival, and among the all the bourbon barrel aged stouts and double IPAs, the beer that stood out the most to us was the Mango\/Chipotle Ale from The BOB Brewery. The smokiness and heat from the chipotle really complimented the sweetness from the malt and mango. It was surprising and refreshing; it also definitely cleared your palate from all the heavier beers.\n\nShortly after that, we were trying to figure out what to brew. I was thinking a chili pepper beer, but I wasn't sure what the reaction would be. I threw it out there, and we were all immediately excited and hopped online to try to find out how exactly they worked. Most chili beers are rather pale with a light, simple malt base that lets the chili flavor shine through. Our plan was to go a little different. We wanted those roasty, smoky flavors in the malt that would play off the smokiness of the chipotle and give the feeling of a BBQ. Tasting notes are after the recipe.\n<h3>Mash<\/h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>8lbs 2 Row Malt<\/li>\n\t<li>1lb CaraFa II<\/li>\n\t<li>1lb 40L Crystal<\/li>\n\t<li>.5lb Special Blend<\/li>\n\t<li>.25lb Roasted Barley (400L)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n70 minute, single infusion mash at about 155ºF\n<h3>Boil<\/h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>1oz EKG at 60 minutes<\/li>\n\t<li>3 Jalapeño Peppers washed and halved at 15 minutes<\/li>\n\t<li>1tsp Irish Moss at 15 Minutes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThe Jalapeños were removed after the boil, which we thought was a mistake at the time; although, the beer certainly tastes good.\n<h3>Fermentation<\/h3>\nWe used Wyeast 1056 with no started in our 6.5gal glass carboy. We added 3 halved chipotles into the carboy as well (we washed and microwaved them to kill any microbes). Our original gravity was 1.054\n\nAfter about 6 days, we racked it to secondary and added 4 more chipotles and 3 washed and halved habañeros. We tasted it multiple times a day. After 5-6 days we kegged and force carbed it.\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\nOH MY GOSH THIS IS SO GOOD!\n\nNow that that's out of the way… It's very dark with a thick, tan head which takes its time melting away.

There was either a free taco bar or hot wings, but more glorious was the $2.50 bottles of Arcadia Ales. I like a lot of what Arcadia does, but their Scotch Ale will forever have a place in my liver after that summer.  We wanted to created a beer that had that great malt backbone, a decent sweetness and a good kick of alcohol.  To try something new, we also wanted to do some faux bourbon barrel aging. Tasting notes are below the recipe.\r\n<h3>Mash<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>8lbs Golden Promise<\/li>\r\n\t<li>.5lb 40L Crystal<\/li>\r\n\t<li>.25 Aromatic Malt<\/li>\r\n\t<li>.25 Munich<\/li>\r\n\t<li>.25 Biscuit Malt<\/li>\r\n\t<li>.1lb Roasted Barley<\/li>\r\n\t<li>.1lb Black Patent Malt<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWe did a 60 minute, single infusion mash at about 155ºF. We sparged with about 5 gallons of water to end up with about 6g of runnings.\r\n<h3>Boil<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>2lbs Light Malt Extract<\/li>\r\n\t<li>1lb Brown Sugar or Golden Syrup<\/li>\r\n\t<li>1.5oz EKG at 60 minutes<\/li>\r\n\t<li>.25oz Fuggles and .5oz EKG at 15 minutes<\/li>\r\n\t<li>.75oz Fuggles dry hopped<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Fermentation<\/h3>\r\nWe used Wyeast 1728 without a starter. After about 10 days of primary fermentation, we moved it to secondary with French Roasted Oak chips that had been soaking in Jack Daniels for at least two hours*. We pulled a little out to taste it every so often, and when the flavor seemed balanced, we racked it into a keg and force carbed it.\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\nThis is one  of my favorite beers that we've ever made. This along with our Peanut Butter Porter are the only beers we have made twice. The first time we made this it was also our first successful kegging attempt, and the keg was empty in a little over a week. This time, we decided to try to savor it more; although, it still didn't last very long.\r\n\r\nThe ale pours a dark, reddish brown with a generally thick, cream colored head. You instantly smell the bourbon but there is also very nice malt sweetness along with it. The beer has a rich, velvety mouthfeel that is very smooth. The flavor from the oak and bourbon is mainly caramels and vanillas that add a depth to the malt flavor of the basic scotch ale. If you enjoy malty beers, definitely give this one a go.","post_title":"Oak'd Wee Heavy Recipe","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"268-revision-5","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-08-10 08:10:59","post_modified_gmt":"2010-08-10 15:10:59","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"268","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/268-revision-5\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Making sure your beer fits the style guide, having just the right amount of CO2, final gravity, etc., is fun and a challenge (artists learn to immitate the greats before they go off and do their own thing), but the most important thing about brewing beer, that sometimes gets lost in the shuffle is this: Beer is for drinking. You don't need to stress about having just the right grain bill, or just the right length of boil, etc. Just go out there and brew something.\r\n\r\nThat's the methodology in this beer. With no idea for what to brew, I happened to be driving by <a title=\"Adventures in Homebrewing\" href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewing.org\/\">Adventures in Homebrewing<\/a>, where we generally buy our supplies, and, since it's normally 45 minutes away from where we live, I thought that I should swing by and pick something up. While many of our beers have had a focus on unique or interesting flavor profiles, I set out on this beer with more of a focus on the aroma, and this is what I threw together.\r\n<h3>Mash<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>6lbs 2 Row Malt<\/li>\r\n\t<li>2lb Belgian Aromatic Malt<\/li>\r\n\t<li>1lb Flaked Rye<\/li>\r\n\t<li>1lb Victory Malt<\/li>\r\n\t<li>.5lb 40L Crystal<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n75 minute, mash at about 165ºF\r\n<h3>Boil<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>2\/3oz Kent Goldings at 60 minutes<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Fermentation<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>White Labs WLPoo8 East Coast Ale Yeast<\/li>\r\n\t<li>4\/3 oz Kent Goldings Dry Hop<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nFermentation really took off on this beer. While the spewing CO2 wasn't quite to the level of the Barley Wine, the WLP008 rapidly took the beer down from an OG of ~1.052 to our FG of 1.002, which was pretty impressive, considering the attentuation should be around 70-75%\r\n\r\nThe East Coast Ale yeast has a neutral character that wouldn't get in the way of the other ingredients allowing us to get a better sense of how each part of the grain bill came out in the nose.\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\nThis beer is kind of weird, but certainly not in a bad way. When I think of a brown ale, a malty sweetness along with a full body usually comes to mind. With this beer, almost all the sweetness is in the aroma, where it is very forceful. The taste of the beer itself is quite dry with a decent malt backbone. There are some hops, but those too come out mainly in the nose. At about 5.4% ABV, this is, for us, a nice session ale that can provide a bit of refreshment after a couple pints of our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/chili-pepper-beer-recipe\/\">chili pepper beer<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<\/div>","post_title":"Flying-By-The-Seat-Of-Our-Pants Dry Brown Ale","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"flying-by-the-seat-of-our-pants-dry-brown-ale","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-08-16 11:00:47","post_modified_gmt":"2010-08-16 18:00:47","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=298","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The places that fall within that category that I've also been to (as a drinking establishment, not just for dinner):\r\n<blockquote>The wine scene is just as vibrant. Fatherdaughter team John and Kristin Jonna (who formerly worked for Benziger Winery) opened <strong>Vinology Wine Bar and Restaurant <\/strong>(110 S. Main Street; <a href=\"http:\/\/vinowinebars.com\"><em>vinowinebars.com<\/em><\/a>), in downtown Ann Arbor during 2006. Pair seasonally inspired small plates with an impressive wine list that includes 38 wines by the glass. Don’t miss the “bubble room” downstairs—an intimate space with 400 hand-blown glass balls suspended from the ceiling; it’s next to a retail wine shop.<\/blockquote>\r\nThe wine list at vinology is insane, but they do also have a beer menu, including craft brews from Bells, New Holland, Flying Dog, and others. The rest come in a trifecta:\r\n<blockquote>And what would a university town be without microbreweries? In 1995 Rene and Matt Grieff opened Arbor Brewing Company Pub &amp; Eatery (114 E. Washington Street; <a href=\"http:\/\/arborbrewing.com\"><em>arborbrewing.com<\/em><\/a>). Always evolving, their latest mantra is to buy from local, sustainable producers to build items like stone-grilled pizzas and corned beef sandwiches. Drop in for a pint of light (Brasserie Blonde) or dark beer (Espresso Love Breakfast Stout). Much of the food at<em><strong> <\/strong><\/em><strong>Jolly Pumpkin Café &amp; Brewery<\/strong> (311 S. Main Street; <a href=\"http:\/\/jollypumpkin.com\"><em>jollypumpkin.com<\/em><\/a>), comes from local farmers markets.

Jolly Pumpkin is rather Belgian-focused, but even as a huge fan of the style, I haven't found a beer there that I'm particularly enamored with. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/06\/original-gravity-two-year-anniversary\/\">Original Gravity<\/a> is new to us as of this summer, click the link for Paul's thoughts on our first trip there.\r\n\r\nWhat's missing? I guess some of these might not be relevant to the wine drinker, so their exclusion makes sense (though Zingerman's Deli doesn't serve wine either... hm), but Grizzly Peak, Ashleys, and Blue Tractor are at least notable for a first time visitor to our fair city.\r\n\r\n(HT: Ann Arbor Chronicle for <a href=\"http:\/\/annarborchronicle.com\/2010\/08\/19\/a2-food-drink\/\">pointing out the original article<\/a>)","post_title":"Wine Enthusiast: Destination Ann Arbor","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"wine-enthusiast-destination-ann-arbor","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-08-19 16:44:44","post_modified_gmt":"2010-08-19 23:44:44","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=341","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The first I can remember is the Kuhnhenn Ring of Fire that jumped off the menu at The Hopcat. Since then there's been the Original Gravity Pepper Smoker, New Holland Mole Ocho and a few others. There's something really different about drinking a cold beer and feeling the capsaicin heat all throughout your body.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, the Michigan Brewers Guild held their Summer Beer Festival, and among the all the bourbon barrel aged stouts and double IPAs, the beer that stood out the most to us was the Mango\/Chipotle Ale from The BOB Brewery. The smokiness and heat from the chipotle really complimented the sweetness from the malt and mango. It was surprising and refreshing; it also definitely cleared your palate from all the heavier beers.\r\n\r\nShortly after that, we were trying to figure out what to brew. I was thinking a chili pepper beer, but I wasn't sure what the reaction would be. I threw it out there, and we were all immediately excited and hopped online to try to find out how exactly they worked. Most chili beers are rather pale with a light, simple malt base that lets the chili flavor shine through. Our plan was to go a little different. We wanted those roasty, smoky flavors in the malt that would play off the smokiness of the chipotle and give the feeling of a BBQ. Tasting notes are after the recipe.\r\n<h3>Mash<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>8lbs 2 Row Malt<\/li>\r\n\t<li>1lb CaraFa II<\/li>\r\n\t<li>1lb 40L Crystal<\/li>\r\n\t<li>.5lb Special Blend<\/li>\r\n\t<li>.25lb Roasted Barley (400L)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n70 minute, single infusion mash at about 155ºF\r\n<h3>Boil<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>1oz EKG at 60 minutes<\/li>\r\n\t<li>3 Jalapeño Peppers washed and halved at 15 minutes<\/li>\r\n\t<li>1tsp Irish Moss at 15 Minutes<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe Jalapeños were removed after the boil, which we thought was a mistake at the time; although, the beer certainly tastes good.\r\n<h3>Fermentation<\/h3>\r\nWe used Wyeast 1056 with no started in our 6.5gal glass carboy. We added 3 halved chipotles into the carboy as well (we washed and microwaved them to kill any microbes). Our original gravity was 1.054\r\n\r\nAfter about 6 days, we racked it to secondary and added 4 more chipotles and 3 washed and halved habañeros. We tasted it multiple times a day. After 5-6 days we kegged and force carbed it.\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\nOH MY GOSH THIS IS SO GOOD!\r\n\r\nNow that that's out of the way… It's very dark with a thick, tan head which takes its time melting away. The smell is a ton of that beautiful, smoky chipotle aroma with a bit of a heat from the habañero. The flavor is well balanced with a good, dark malt base mixing with the smoky heat of the chipotle. It finishes with a tingling heat on the back and side of your tongue.

I can't imagine what the past year would have been like had Tim not had that impulse or we as a group didn't follow through.\r\n\r\nSome of you reading this may have some apprehension about starting down the home brew path, but I hope to show that home brewing is really something almost anybody can do.\r\n<h3>It's Just Too Expensive!<\/h3>\r\nThere is a fairly significant initial capital investment for home brewing.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/05\/getting-started-how-what-do-you-need-to-homebrew\/\"> Nate took an inventory of what you <\/a><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/05\/getting-started-how-what-do-you-need-to-homebrew\/\">need<\/a> <\/em>and came up with a total cost of about $105 . An average recipe kit is usually somewhere between $25-30, so you may end up dropping about $140 on your first visit to the homebrew store. $140 dollars is a good chunk of money, but let's drill into this a bit.\r\n\r\nWe can figure out our total beer cost by adding our hardware costs ($140) to the product of software costs ($25 for 55 beers) and beers. So the equation looks like:\r\n<blockquote>Costs = 140 + .455*(Beers)<\/blockquote>\r\nSince we're doing a cost argument, let's say you drink exclusively Pabst Blue Ribbon which you buy in 30 packs. This leads to a simpler equation of:\r\n<blockquote>Costs = .667*(Beers)<\/blockquote>\r\nThese two functions hit an equilibrium at 660 beers (i.e. 12 batches or 22 cases). Beyond your twelfth batch, home brewing is actually <em>less<\/em> expensive*. This is completely disregarding the fact that the beer you will make will almost certainly be more enjoyable than any beer you could get for $20\/case. Once you make that initial investment, home brewing can be fairly inexpensive.\r\n\r\n* I'm ignoring the whole discount rate thing here; it probably wouldn't make that big of a difference.\r\n<h3>I Don't Know The First Thing About Brewing!<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"320\" caption=\"Nate thoroughly reading before we start our first brew\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/_yB8ZIqebwqg\/SiRvyBFhJ0I\/AAAAAAAAA1I\/i4W_qG2JfoM\/s720\/IMG_1167.JPG\"><img class=\" \" title=\"Reading Instruction\" src=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/_yB8ZIqebwqg\/SiRvyBFhJ0I\/AAAAAAAAA1I\/i4W_qG2JfoM\/s720\/IMG_1167.JPG\" alt=\"Nate thoroughly reading before we start our first brew\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn all truth, we didn't know that much when we started. In the build up before actually buying or kit, we each read online at the many excellent resources (e.g. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewtalk.com\" target=\"_blank\">homebrew talk<\/a>), and talked about different hints and advice we'd seen. This may have actually complicated things, because we had so many different inputs during our first brew day. Honestly, for your first time brewing, read the instructions that come with your kit through several times, make notes of what you'll need at certain stages and then follow them meticulously. Being a tabula rasa may actually be a benefit in this case. There aren't very many steps to brewing, and most kit instructions spell them all out very clearly.\r\n<h3>What If I Screw Up?<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"230\" caption=\"Using our makeshift funnel\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/_yB8ZIqebwqg\/SiRwlu5gviI\/AAAAAAAAA4A\/2Yod6qp8hjQ\/s512\/IMG_1208.JPG\"><img title=\"Makeshift Funnel\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/_yB8ZIqebwqg\/SiRwlu5gviI\/AAAAAAAAA4A\/2Yod6qp8hjQ\/s512\/IMG_1208.JPG\" alt=\"Using our makeshift funnel\" width=\"230\" height=\"307\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOur first brew day, things went swimmingly until we were supposed to add sterile water (boiled\/distilled) to our wort. Well, we didn't have any distilled water and my stove couldn't handle another pot boiling water, so Tim and Nate went to another apartment, microwaved water until it boiled, poured into our sanitized carboy and brought it (imagine them struggling down the street carrying a 6.5 gallon glass bottle half full of 180º+ water) back. We added as much as we needed to our wort which was still in our brew pot. We then needed to pour from our pot into the carboy, but we didn't have a funnel, so we cut the bottom off of a plastic liter of rum and used that. We probably tossed the yeast in when the wort was about 110º and the carboy itself was heated from transporting the water.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"184\" caption=\"Our first beer!\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/_yB8ZIqebwqg\/SiwRy_aw5SI\/AAAAAAAABCg\/KBLlCAAczm4\/s512\/IMG_1310.JPG\"><img class=\"  \" title=\"Our first beer\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/_yB8ZIqebwqg\/SiwRy_aw5SI\/AAAAAAAABCg\/KBLlCAAczm4\/s512\/IMG_1310.JPG\" alt=\"Our first beer!\" width=\"184\" height=\"246\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWhy am I telling you this? We were a comedy of errors for a large section of the brewing process and <strong>we still made beer!<\/strong> It wasn't the best Pale Ale I've ever had, but it was definitely the most satisfying. Beer is actually fairly forgiving if you're not going for perfection. Accidentally add hops early? Added too much malt extract? You'll still have beer.\r\n\r\nThe one exception to this concept is sanitation. If you're going to be obsessive about anything, make it sanitation. Everything that comes into contact with your beer at any phase should be clean (washed, free of any visible particles), and anything that comes into contact with your wort after you take it off the stove has to be sanitized (using OneStep, StarSan, bleach water, etc.). Other than that, while you should try to follow the instructions, if you mess up, in the words of the immortal (at least so far) Charlie Papazian, \"Relax, don't worry and have a home brew!\"\r\n\r\n<em>All images come from our first time brewing.

Making sure your beer fits the style guide, having just the right about of CO2, final gravity, etc. is fun and a challenge (artists learn to immitate the greats before they go off and do their own thing), but the most important thing about brewing beer, that sometimes gets lost in the shuffle is this: Beer is for drinking. You don't need to stress about having just the right grain bill, or just the right length of boil, etc. Just go out there and brew something.\n\nThat's the methodology in this beer. With no idea for what to brew, I happened to be driving by <a title=\"Adventures in Homebrewing\" href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewing.org\/\">Adventures in Homebrewing<\/a>, where we generally buy our supplies, and, since it's normally 45 minutes away from where we live, I should swing by and pick something up.

Making sure your beer fits the style guide, having just the right about of CO2, final gravity, etc. is fun and a challenge (artists learn to immitate the greats before they go off and do their own thing), but the most important thing about brewing beer, that sometimes gets lost in the shuffle is this: Beer is for drinking. You don't need to stress about having just the right grain bill, or just the right length of boil, etc. Just go out there and brew something.\r\n\r\nThat's the methodology in this beer. With no idea for what to brew, I happened to be driving by <a title=\"Adventures in Homebrewing\" href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewing.org\/\">Adventures in Homebrewing<\/a>, where we generally buy our supplies, and, since it's normally 45 minutes away from where we live, I should swing by and pick something up. While many of our beers have had a focus on unique or interesting flavor profiles, I set out on this beer with more of a focus on the aroma, and this is what I threw together.\r\n<h3>Mash<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>6lbs 2 Row Malt<\/li>\r\n\t<li>2lb Belgian Aromatic Malt<\/li>\r\n\t<li>1lb Flaked Rye<\/li>\r\n\t<li>1lb Victory Malt<\/li>\r\n\t<li>.5lb 40L Crystal<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n75 minute, mash at about 165ºF\r\n<h3>Boil<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>2\/3oz Kent Goldings at 60 minutes<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Fermentation<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>White Labs WLPoo8 East Coast Ale Yeast<\/li>\r\n\t<li>4\/3 oz Kent Goldings Dry Hop<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nFermentation really took off on this beer. While the spewing CO2 wasn't quite to the level of the Barley Wine, the WLP008 rapidly took the beer down from an OG of ~1.052 to our FG of 1.002, which was pretty impressive, considering the attentuation should be around 70-75%\r\n\r\nThe East Coast Ale yeast has a neutral character that wouldn't get in the way of the other ingredients allowing us to get a better sense of how each part of the grain bill came out in the nose.\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\n<\/div>","post_title":"Flying-By-The-Seat-Of-Our-Pants Dry Brown Ale","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"298-revision-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-08-15 07:28:40","post_modified_gmt":"2010-08-15 14:28:40","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"298","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/298-revision-2\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Then, our local homebrew shop was all out of lambic yeasts (must be a popular style this time of year - who knew?).

A friend of mine brewed a couple batches, and the beer was great, but he never really talked to much about the set up or process, so home brewing was still shrouded in mystery.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"320\" caption=\"The kit that started it all\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/_yB8ZIqebwqg\/SiRvpwaprHI\/AAAAAAAAA0k\/98zxXJsUYp8\/s720\/IMG_1157.JPG\"><img class=\"  \" title=\"New Brewing Kit\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/_yB8ZIqebwqg\/SiRvpwaprHI\/AAAAAAAAA0k\/98zxXJsUYp8\/s720\/IMG_1157.JPG\" alt=\"Our home brewing kit\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nEventually last Summer, Tim just made the executive that we were going to go buy a home brewing kit <em>today<\/em>! In eight hours we went from idle chat to having everything we needed to brew our first beer. We have never looked back from that initial step. I can't imagine what the past year would have been like had Tim not had that impulse or we as a group didn't follow through.\n\nSome of you reading this may have some apprehension about starting down the home brew path, but I hope to show that home brewing is really something almost anybody can do.\n<h3>It's Just Too Expensive!<\/h3>\nThere is a fairly significant initial capital investment for home brewing.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/05\/getting-started-how-what-do-you-need-to-homebrew\/\"> Nate took an inventory of what you <\/a><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/05\/getting-started-how-what-do-you-need-to-homebrew\/\">need<\/a> <\/em>and came up with a total cost of about $105 . An average recipe kit is usually somewhere between $25-30, so you may end up dropping about $140 on your first visit to the homebrew store. $140 dollars is a good chunk of money, but let's drill into this a bit.\n\nWe can figure out our total beer cost by adding our hardware costs ($105) to the product of software costs ($25 for 55 beers) and beers. So the equation looks like:\n<blockquote>Costs = 105 + .455*(Beers)<\/blockquote>\nSince we're doing a cost argument, let's say you drink exclusively Pabst Blue Ribbon which you buy in 30 packs. This leads to a simpler equation of:\n<blockquote>Costs = .667*(Beers)<\/blockquote>\nThese two functions hit an equilibrium at 495 beers (i.e. 9 batches or 17 cases). Beyond your twelfth batch, home brewing is actually <em>less<\/em> expensive*. This is completely disregarding the fact that the beer you will make will almost certainly be more enjoyable than any beer you could get for $20\/case. Once you make that initial investment, home brewing can be fairly inexpensive.\n\n* I'm ignoring the whole discount rate thing here; it probably wouldn't make that big of a difference.\n<h3>I Don't Know The First Thing About Brewing!<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"320\" caption=\"Nate thoroughly reading before we start our first brew\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/_yB8ZIqebwqg\/SiRvyBFhJ0I\/AAAAAAAAA1I\/i4W_qG2JfoM\/s720\/IMG_1167.JPG\"><img class=\" \" title=\"Reading Instruction\" src=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/_yB8ZIqebwqg\/SiRvyBFhJ0I\/AAAAAAAAA1I\/i4W_qG2JfoM\/s720\/IMG_1167.JPG\" alt=\"Nate thoroughly reading before we start our first brew\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nIn all truth, we didn't know that much when we started. In the build up before actually buying or kit, we each read online at the many excellent resources (e.g. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewtalk.com\" target=\"_blank\">homebrew talk<\/a>), and talked about different hints and advice we'd seen. This may have actually complicated things, because we had so many different inputs during our first brew day. Honestly, for your first time brewing, read the instructions that come with your kit through several times, make notes of what you'll need at certain stages and then follow them meticulously. Being a tabula rasa may actually be a benefit in this case. There aren't very many steps to brewing, and most kit instructions spell them all out very clearly.\n<h3>What If I Screw Up?<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"230\" caption=\"Using our makeshift funnel\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/_yB8ZIqebwqg\/SiRwlu5gviI\/AAAAAAAAA4A\/2Yod6qp8hjQ\/s512\/IMG_1208.JPG\"><img title=\"Makeshift Funnel\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/_yB8ZIqebwqg\/SiRwlu5gviI\/AAAAAAAAA4A\/2Yod6qp8hjQ\/s512\/IMG_1208.JPG\" alt=\"Using our makeshift funnel\" width=\"230\" height=\"307\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nOur first brew day, things went swimmingly until we were supposed to add sterile water (boiled\/distilled) to our wort. Well, we didn't have any distilled water and my stove couldn't handle another pot boiling water, so Tim and Nate went to another apartment, microwaved water until it boiled, poured into our sanitized carboy and brought it (imagine them struggling down the street carrying a 6.5 gallon glass bottle half full of 180º+ water) back. We added as much as we needed to our wort which was still in our brew pot. We then needed to pour from our pot into the carboy, but we didn't have a funnel, so we cut the bottom off of a plastic liter of rum and used that. We probably tossed the yeast in when the wort was about 110º and the carboy itself was heated from transporting the water.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"184\" caption=\"Our first beer!\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/_yB8ZIqebwqg\/SiwRy_aw5SI\/AAAAAAAABCg\/KBLlCAAczm4\/s512\/IMG_1310.JPG\"><img class=\"  \" title=\"Our first beer\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/_yB8ZIqebwqg\/SiwRy_aw5SI\/AAAAAAAABCg\/KBLlCAAczm4\/s512\/IMG_1310.JPG\" alt=\"Our first beer!\" width=\"184\" height=\"246\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nWhy am I telling you this? We were a comedy of errors for a large section of the brewing process and <strong>we still made beer!<\/strong> It wasn't the best Pale Ale I've ever had, but it was definitely the most satisfying. Beer is actually fairly forgiving if you're not going for perfection. Accidentally add hops early? Added too much malt extract? You'll still have beer.\n\nThe one exception to this concept is sanitation. If you're going to be obsessive about anything, make it sanitation. Everything that comes into contact with your beer at any phase should be clean (washed, free of any visible particles), and anything that comes into contact with your wort after you take it off the stove has to be sanitized (using OneStep, StarSan, bleach water, etc.). Other than that, while you should try to follow the instructions, if you mess up, in the words of the immortal (at least so far) Charlie Papazian, \"Relax, don't worry and have a home brew!\"\n\n<em>All images come from our first time brewing.

The places that fall within that category that I've also been to (as a drinking establishment, not just for dinner):\n<blockquote>The wine scene is just as vibrant. Fatherdaughter team John and Kristin Jonna (who formerly worked for Benziger Winery) opened <strong>Vinology Wine Bar and Restaurant <\/strong>(110 S. Main Street; <a href=\"http:\/\/vinowinebars.com\"><em>vinowinebars.com<\/em><\/a>), in downtown Ann Arbor during 2006. Pair seasonally inspired small plates with an impressive wine list that includes 38 wines by the glass. Don’t miss the “bubble room” downstairs—an intimate space with 400 hand-blown glass balls suspended from the ceiling; it’s next to a retail wine shop.<\/blockquote>\nThe wine list at vinology is insane, but they do also have a beer menu, including craft brews from Bells, New Holland, Flying Dog, and others. The rest come in a trifecta:\n<blockquote>And what would a university town be without microbreweries? In 1995 Rene and Matt Grieff opened Arbor Brewing Company Pub &amp; Eatery (114 E. Washington Street; <a href=\"http:\/\/arborbrewing.com\"><em>arborbrewing.com<\/em><\/a>). Always evolving, their latest mantra is to buy from local, sustainable producers to build items like stone-grilled pizzas and corned beef sandwiches. Drop in for a pint of light (Brasserie Blonde) or dark beer (Espresso Love Breakfast Stout). Much of the food at<em><strong> <\/strong><\/em><strong>Jolly Pumpkin Café &amp; Brewery<\/strong> (311 S.

The majority of these changes were on the basis of ingredient availability.\r\n\r\nWhereas last time, we used habanero peppers for heat and chipotle peppers to give a smoky flavor, the grocery store, unfortunately, was out of habaneros when I went to acquire ingredients to make another batch of our (outstanding) recipe. Instead, I picked up the peppers with the highest <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scoville_scale\">Scoville rating<\/a> out of what the store had available, eventually settling on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tradewindsfruit.com\/hot_peppers.htm\">serrano huasteco<\/a>. Unfortunately, they're only 1\/10th as hot as habaneros.\r\n\r\nSo, with the same number of chipotles, but replacing habaneros with serranos, to secondary we went. After a few days, we still weren't getting the heat we wanted (oh, the glory of a spigoted ale pail), so it was back to the grocery store to purchase habaneros. We threw a couple of those bad boys in, and then waited a week or so.\r\n\r\nEventually, we tested again, and the beer had plenty of heat, but not the smoky flavor we wanted. Using a slotted spoon, we scooped out most of the hot peppers, but left the chipotles. I kegged five days later...\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\nThis edition is much hotter than the first, primarily since the peppers stayed in secondary longer. Whereas batch #1 would sneak up on you after a couple sips, this one isn't hiding any heat. It also has a different flavor mix, with a bit more earthiness (from the serranos) to go along with the heat. Alas, the chipotle smokiness is covered up by the other things.\r\n\r\nIf we were to make this beer again (something I think is probably pretty likely), I would prefer to make it from the original recipe, with an emphasis on the smoky flavors, and just enough heat to complement that.

The beer was available in a limited number of 750ml bottles and 21 kegs were released to 21 of Rogue's oldest bar patrons. As it happens, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ashleys.com\/\">Ashley's<\/a> is one of those lucky 21, and we took in this event back in the late days of summer. Without further ado, the beers:\r\n<h3>Rogue 21st Anniversary Ale<\/h3>\r\n\r\nQuite a sweet, malty flavor - It tastes like it's a scotch or old ale. There's a very low hop presence, and almost none at all in the aroma.\r\n\r\nThere's alcohol taste on the tongue, but it's not overwhelming. As sweet as the finished beer is, they certainly could have fermented it down a little more to remove sweetness and make it a little stronger.\r\n\r\nThe description says it's brewed with molasses (which helps bring the scotch-ish flavor) and brewer's licorice, though I don't think there's any anise flavor or aroma.\r\n<h3>Rogue J.J. Hazelnut<\/h3>\r\nThe John John beers are aged in Whiskey barrels, and the Hazelnut is a brown ale brewed (of course) with hazelnut flavor.\r\n\r\nThere's no strong aroma of anything before you sip. No real hops or sweetness on the nose. The flavor is overwhelmingly oak whiskey barrel-aged, to the point of covering up any other flavor. There's a bit of dry acridity to it that you expect from a whiskey-aged beer.\r\n\r\nMy hypothesis is that this beer was aged too long, and took on too much flavor from the barrel, covering up the original flavors of the hazelnut brown. Practically the only flavors come from the barrel.\r\n\r\nIf you let the beer percolate in your mouth a bit prior to swallowing, there's a bit of malty sweetness, though it's impossible to determine the underlying flavors. If this beer was served at a bit warmer temperature, maybe these flavors would be more apparent.\r\n<h3>Rogue J.J. Dead Guy<\/h3>\r\nThe Dead Guy Ale is one of Rogue's flagship beers, and the John John version of it is, as you'd expect, a whiskey barrel-aged version of the classic maibock. This isn't as over-aged as the hazelnut was, and the oak is an understated flavor. There's a little \"bite\" from it at the beginning, but it wears off the more you drink (it's up to the reader to decide if that's due to temperature, drunkenness, or something else).\r\n\r\nThis beer is quite sweet both on the nose and in flavor. There's a very subtle sour or fruity taste you'd associate with a Belgian - but it's barely there. For a typically well-hopped style in Maibocks, there's almost no hop presence.\r\n<h3>Stone 14th Anniversary Ale<\/h3>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_475\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"mmmmm... Ashley&#39;s\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/ashleys.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-475\" title=\"ashleys\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/ashleys-300x224.png\" alt=\"mmmmm... Ashley's\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]This was obviously the odd beer out, as the other offerings all came from Rogue, and this is a Stone brew. The boys in Escondido created an \"Emperial IPA,\" or a double imperial IPA to celebrate 14 years.\r\n\r\nThe aroma isn't too hoppy, especially for what you'd expect out of the style, but what hops are discernible are of a sweeter variety.\r\n\r\nIn the flavor, however, it's all hops (in multiple senses). The overwhelming taste is hop bitterness and flavor, though with a variety of hops, instead of the exclusively sweet ones that were in the aroma. The malt flavors are sweet, but also a bit spicy, leaving us to speculate there's rye in the mash.","post_title":"Rogue 21st Anniversary","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"rogue-21st-anniversary","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-10-19 20:01:42","post_modified_gmt":"2010-10-20 00:01:42","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=348","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

If you haven't tried their beer yet, well, you should. I'm from the Grand Rapids area, and every time I head home to see the family I try to get out to their tap house which has $3.75 (!) pints of many of their brews. The only beer clone we've ever brewed was an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/06\/recipe-reds-rye-clone\/\">imitation of Red's Rye<\/a>.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is that Founders is awesome. One of the biggest reasons for this, is how much they still seem to have that homebrewer's mindset. They're always experimenting, coming up with interesting and innovative beers. The best example of this may be their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foundersbrewing.com\/foundersnew\/beer\/\">Nemesis Ale<\/a>. Here's how the brewers describe it:\n<blockquote>What you have here is a rarity. A special, one-of-a-kind ale that is only made once a year. Sometimes that’s all. Forever. No more. Nada.

Despite the different processes, the flavor is almost a clone. Cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla, maybe a bit of honey. The body was a little lighter than I'd expect out of the style (I guess \"S'more Porter\" doesn't quite have the same ring to it), but the color was damn near black.\r\n\r\nThe differences between their beer and ours come mostly in the clean finish of the professional version, in no small part because we were still working our way through the brewing process at the time we made our s'more stout.

Last year, Tim's girlfriend requested it, and, always up for a challenge, we gave it a go. It turned amazingly well considering our experience and the all the flavorings we introduced.\n\nWhen thinking about s'mores, we tried to abstract the elements away to their essential flavors. For the chocolate, we used baking cocoa powder mixed with lactose. For the graham cracker, we used some biscuit malt for a breadiness and cinnamon. Finally, the marshmallow is kind of tough. We just figured most marshmallow's have a vanilla flavor, so we used extract. We decided on the base of a stout because that malt profile can stand up to those flavors and keep it a beer as well as the acrid flavors being appropriate for a s'more made over a campfire.\n\nLike I mentioned, the biggest problem was a grittiness from the cocoa powder. This year we tried to fix that. We made a tea out of the cocoa, lactose and cinnamon stick. We brought this up to a boil, stirring almost constantly. We tasted it on the way through, and by the end, most of the grittiness was gone. Hopefully, it will stay that way through fermentation. One final change is that we had some honey left over from our mead, and we used about half a pound added in at the tail end of our boil to add into that graham cracker profile.\n<h3>Mash<\/h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>6lbs Maris Otter<\/li>\n\t<li>1.5lbs Biscuit Malt<\/li>\n\t<li>1lb 60L Crystal<\/li>\n\t<li>1lb CarafaII<\/li>\n\t<li>1\/2lb Special B<\/li>\n\t<li>1\/2lb Flaked Oats<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nWe mashed at a higher temperature (between about 156-160ºF). It mashed for quite a while as we took the free time to head out for a run.\n<h3>Boil<\/h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>1oz Fuggles (60 minutes)<\/li>\n\t<li>1oz Fuggles (30 minutes)<\/li>\n\t<li>1\/2lb Honey (15 minutes)<\/li>\n\t<li>Irish Moss (15 minutes)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nIn a second pot we mixed a bit of wort, half a pound of lactose,  cocoa to taste and a cinnamon stick. We let that boil down as our main boil went. Original gravity: 1.058.\n<h3>Fermentation<\/h3>\nWe used<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wyeastlab.com\/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=141\" target=\"_blank\"> Wyeast 1335<\/a> (British Ale Yeast II). We don't want it to ferment too low, so it will stay a sweeter, desert stout. We're looking for a Final Gravity between 1.017-1.020. We'll let it set in secondary for a few weeks before we keg.","post_title":"Recipe: S’More Stout","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"recipe-s%e2%80%99more-stout","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-10-18 21:43:16","post_modified_gmt":"2010-10-19 01:43:16","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=414","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

This is, overall, a good thing, but when I was just dropping in to make a quick purchase en route, I kind of wanted to go with something dependable.\n\nThen I saw Cane and Ebel. It's an American Pale Ale made with Rye that clocks in at 7% ABV and 68IBUs. It's described by Two Brothers as:\n<blockquote>Dry but with a creamy touch of Thai palm sugar and the spicy tang of rye, all balanced by loads of our wackiest new hops we could lay our hands on.  Yep, it's an original. And it's no sin.<\/blockquote>\nDespite the brewer's claim that it's an original, I bought it because it reminded of Founder's Red's Rye (quite possibly my favorite \"standard\" beer), and rye is one of my favorite non-standard ingredients.\n\nThe beer pours a dark, reddish brown with a thick, creamy head that laces its way down the glass. There's plenty of citrusy, grapefruit hops in the nose. The beer is smooth with a good mouthfeel. The grain bill manages to stand up to all the hops, and the rye gives it that unique, spicy flavor that gets me every time.\n\nI'd definitely order this at a bar or pick up another 6-pack.","post_title":"Beer Review: Two Brothers Cane & Ebel","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"398-autosave","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-10-04 23:03:08","post_modified_gmt":"2010-10-05 03:03:08","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"398","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/10\/398-autosave\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

This happens not in the brewing process, or even when kegging, but rather when the beers are poured into a glass to drink.\r\n\r\nSome micro-breweries, such as Founder's in Grand Rapids, will give you a blend if you request it, with such concoctions as the \"DubMudgeon\" (a mix between their <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/1199\/24905\">Curmudgeon<\/a> Old Ale and <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/1199\/34146\">Double Trouble<\/a> Double IPA). Even some restaurants, not known for their beer, are conjuring up mixes. I've had the \"Blasphemy\" recommended to me, a mix between Founder's Pale Ale and Bell's Two Hearted IPA. This seems to be hitting the mainstream.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, we decided to give it a go for ourselves. We have a number of bottled beers, and Beat the Irish Stout, Pepper Porter 2 (re-named \"Couch Fire Ale\" in honor of the Michigan State game) and the Boiling Greens DIPA on tap, in addition to a few microbrews, including a number of offerings from Short's Brewing.\r\n\r\nThe obvious mix is Stout + Porter, because the styles are rather similar, and it would cut the excessive heat from the pepper. The mix is exactly as expected, with a flavor that's mostly just a less-heated version of the pepper porter, with a little bit more body.\r\n\r\nThe more interesting mix was between Short's Bloody Beer and the Pepper Porter. The concept itself mixes two beers that focus primarily on the non-beer flavors (capsicum for our offering, bloody mary for Short's), and combine them in a proportion that might make the beer flavor reach a whole greater than the sum of its parts.","post_title":"Blending Brews","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"blending-brews","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-10-15 10:37:19","post_modified_gmt":"2010-10-15 14:37:19","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=406","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

You don't put a wax seal on your beer unless your damn proud of it, right? The fact that it's an imperial porter didn't hurt either. I've seen quite a few imperial stouts, but I can't recall another imperial porter that I've tried.\r\n\r\nThe wax seal was immediately annoying. I had to cut it with my wine key before being able to get the cap off.  Once I did it get it, drinking came pretty easily. Tasting notes follow:\r\n\r\nThe beer pours dark and barely translucent, with a hint of dark copper when held up to the light. There's a small amount of creamy, almost cappuccino like head.\r\n\r\nThe aroma has roasted malt acridity with a hint of woodiness and alcohol. The taste is sweet malt with roasted notes followed with a heavy bit of alcohol and a bit of sourness with some dark stone fruit. The beer has a very creamy, smooth mouthfeel that goes along well with the 8.0% alcohol.\r\n\r\nOverall, this beer is pretty good, but could use a bit more balance and maybe a bit more of the dark, acrid flavors. The alcohol is a bit aggressive, but still fits in with the style of an Imperial Porter. I'm not sure I'd pick this up again, but it was a fun adventure.","post_title":"Beer Review: Ska Brewing Nefarious Ten Pin","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"beer-review-ska-brewing-nefarious-ten-pin","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-10-27 20:18:20","post_modified_gmt":"2010-10-28 00:18:20","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=472","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

However, we've been able to put some things in motion to maintain this site as a resource for beer brewing and drinking.

This brought him to the topic of YLDACs (Young Legal Drinking Aged Consumers). 20 years ago, there was only yellow beer, limited wine and classic spirits. Now there are all sorts of flavored liquors, crazy wines from all over and a ton of competition in beer.

On the other hand, I don't really think it falls in with my conception of a \"craft brewer\" (which isn't a quality thing as much as not coming from the modern homebrewing movement). Mr. Leinenkugel says he considers his Leinenkugel's a regional brewery, especially since 85% of their business is done in the Big Ten footprint.\r\n\r\nFinally, he brought with him this year's Big Eddy which is an Imperial Stout that clocks in at 9.5% ABV and about 74IBU.

When I told him a lot of my friends who don't like beer like Sunset Wheat he asked me \"and what do they say it tastes like?\" I was a little nervous to say a beer his company makes tastes like Fruity Pebbles, but it... uh... does. He told me that is what 95% percent of people say it tastes like. This brought him to the topic of YLDACs (Young Legal Drinking Aged Consumers). 20 years ago, there was only yellow beer, limited wine and classic spirits. Now there are all sorts of flavored liquors, crazy wines from all over and a ton of competition in beer. Also, kids who are turning 21 and have been for the past five or so years (yours truly falls into this age group) have grown up drinking incredibly sweet sodas, sports drinks, energy drinks, etc., and have a very different palate than people 20 or 30 years older.

It's available in the lower 48, been around for over 140 years and sells 12 packs for about $11, yet it certainly doesn't qualify as a macrobrewer. On the other hand, I don't really think it falls in with my conception of a \"craft brewer\" (which isn't a quality thing as much as not coming from the modern homebrewing movement).

Being new to Chicago, I fired up Google Maps to find the best way there, and to my delight, I saw that it was right across the street from the Goose Island Clybourne Brewery and Taphouse.\r\n\r\nSo after Binny's I headed across the street with the smell of malt and wort in the air.

The service was friendly and fast, and the bartenders were always quick with a taste or to explain a beer.

Flavor dominated with malt and wit taste with a bit of the spice lingering through the end<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Oatmeal Stout<\/strong> - 5.1%: <em>A classic English style stout with an aromatic blend of oats, chocalte and roast malts.<\/em><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Notes: poured like motor oil out of the cask tap with almost no head. The taste is velvety and sweet with a hint of stone fruit. It finishes with a very strong, but appropriate acrid note from the roast barley.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>R.I.P.

We went to <a title=\"Adventures in Homebrewing\" href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewing.org\" target=\"_blank\">Adventures in Homebrewing<\/a> to pick up the ingredients for our beer and there were in the middle of packaging their fresh hops. Unfortunately, our schedule is kind of tight, and we had already decided to reprise our S'More Stout to be ready by the holidays.\r\n\r\nSince seeing pound upon pound of fresh hops, I've had a hankering to try some fresh hop beers. I've had some home brewed wet hop beer made with home grown hops at our<a title=\"Ann Arbor Brewer's Guild\" href=\"http:\/\/aabg.org\" target=\"_blank\"> local brewer's guild<\/a> meeting, and they have a very different taste and feel to them. So, when I was at Binny's for the Leinenkugel event and saw the Sierra Nevada Harvest ale, I picked it up.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Sierra Nevada\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sierranevada.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sierra Nevada<\/a> writes on their website:\r\n<blockquote>The cornerstone of our Harvest series is the beer that started the modern-day fresh hop ale phenomenon in America, our original Harvest Ale.\r\n\r\nCreated in 1996, Harvest Ale features Cascade and Centennial hops from the Yakima Valley in Eastern Washington. These hops are harvested and shipped as “wet” un-dried hops—the same day they are picked—to our brewery in Chico where our brewers eagerly wait to get them into the brew kettle while their oils and resins are still at their peak.<\/blockquote>\r\nThe beer pours a light amber with a very small head that has still not completely disapated, but has gently laced down the glass. The aroma has a wet or oily hop note that is both a bit floral and resiny. This is a very different character than most of the west coast pale ales.

Every ingredient comes from their farm in Oregon. In fact, they proudly list their ingredients on their site:\r\n<blockquote>Brewed using 100% OREGON Ingredients. Micro Barley Farm first growth Dare™ &amp; Risk™ Malts; Willamette, Sterling, and First Growth Micro Hopyard Revolution Hops, Pacman Yeast and Free Range Coastal Water.<\/blockquote>\r\nI can appreciate the fully integrated approach. It reminds me of the now Colorado based Leopold Brother's Brewery and Distillery. They were a completely carbon neutral, certified green distillery, brewery and greenhouse. So, going back to my granola munching, Ann Arbor roots, lets give this a try.\r\n\r\nRogue describes it as:\r\n<blockquote>Orange-amber in color, malty aroma, spicy fruity hop flavor with solid malt background and lingering finish.<\/blockquote>\r\nIt poured reddish, orange with a thick, creamy head that was about 2 fingers thick. It slowly laced away but a bit is still on top a few minutes after I poured. The aroma is almost all the malt profile with a bit of the spicy hops. The mouthfeel is amazingly smooth and creamy. The taste is nice, liquidy hops with a bit of with spice afterward. Some of the malt sweetness, character comes through, but it's mainly the hops.\r\n\r\nI'm curious to see where this vertically integrated experiment will go. It follows the movement of a lot of chefs getting more into the origins of their foods. Once there are multiple breweries doing this same integration, we can compare and contrast the different origins and their subtle variations.","post_title":"Beer Review: Rogue OREgasmic Ale","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"433-revision-4","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-10-14 14:20:24","post_modified_gmt":"2010-10-14 18:20:24","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"433","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/10\/433-revision-4\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Last year, Tim's girlfriend requested it, and, always up for a challenge, we gave it a go. It turned amazingly well considering our experience and the all the flavorings we introduced.\n\nWhen thinking about s'mores, we tried to abstract the elements away to their essential flavors. For the chocolate, we used baking cocoa powder mixed with lactose. For the graham cracker, we used some biscuit malt for a breadiness and cinnamon. Finally, the marshmallow is kind of tough. We just figured most marshmallow's have a vanilla flavor, so we used extract. We decided on the base of a stout because that malt profile can stand up to those flavors and keep it a beer as well as the acrid flavors being appropriate for a s'more made over a campfire.\n\nLike I mentioned, the biggest problem was a grittiness from the cocoa powder. This year we tried to fix that. We made a tea out of the cocoa, lactose and cinnamon stick. We brought this up to a boil, stirring almost constantly. We tasted it on the way through, and by the end, most of the grittiness was gone. Hopefully, it will stay that way through fermentation.

The beer was available in a limited number of 750ml bottles and 21 kegs were released to 21 of Rogue's oldest bar patrons. As it happens, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ashleys.com\/\">Ashley's<\/a> is one of those lucky 21, and we took in this event back in the late days of summer. Without further ado, the beers:\r\n\r\nRogue 21st Anniversary Ale\r\n\r\nQuite a sweet, malty flavor - It tastes like it's a scotch or old ale. There's a very low hop presence, and almost none at all in the aroma.\r\n\r\nThere's alcohol taste on the tongue, but it's not overwhelming. As sweet as the finished beer is, they certainly could have fermented it down a little more to remove sweetness and make it a little stronger.\r\n\r\nThe description says it's brewed with molasses (which helps bring the scotch-ish flavor) and brewer's licorice, though I don't think there's any anise flavor or aroma.\r\n\r\nRogue J.J. Hazelnut\r\n\r\nThe John John beers are aged in Whiskey barrels, and the Hazelnut is a brown ale brewed (of course) with hazelnut flavor.\r\n\r\nThere's no strong aroma of anything before you sip. No real hops or sweetness on the nose. The flavor is overwhelmingly oak whiskey barrel-aged, to the point of covering up any other flavor. There's a bit of dry acridity to it that you expect from a whiskey-aged beer.\r\n\r\nMy hypothesis is that this beer was aged too long, and took on too much flavor from the barrel, covering up the original flavors of the hazelnut brown. Practically the only flavors come from the barrel.\r\n\r\nIf you let the beer percolate in your mouth a bit prior to swallowing, there's a bit of malty sweetness, though it's impossible to determine the underlying flavors. If this beer was served at a bit warmer temperature, maybe these flavors would be more apparent.\r\n\r\nRogue J.J. Dead Guy\r\n\r\nThe Dead Guy Ale is one of Rogue's flagship beers, and the John John version of it is, as you'd expect, a whiskey barrel-aged version of the classic maibock. This isn't as over-aged as the hazelnut was, and the oak is an understated flavor. There's a little \"bite\" from it at the beginning, but it wears off the more you drink (it's up to the reader to decide if that's due to temperature, drunkenness, or something else).\r\n\r\nThis beer is quite sweet both on the nose and in flavor. There's a very subtle sour or fruity taste you'd associate with a Belgian - but it's barely there. For a typically well-hopped style in Maibocks, there's almost no hop presence.\r\n\r\nStone 14th Anniversary Ale\r\n\r\nThis was obviously the odd beer out, as the other offerings all came from Rogue, and this is a Stone brew. The boys in Escondido created an \"Emperial IPA,\" or a double imperial IPA to celebrate 14 years.\r\n\r\nThe aroma isn't too hoppy, especially for what you'd expect out of the style, but what hops are discernible are of a sweeter variety.\r\n\r\nIn the flavor, however, it's all hops (in multiple senses). The overwhelming taste is hop bitterness and flavor, though with a variety of hops, instead of the exclusively sweet ones that were in the aroma. The malt flavors are sweet, but also a bit spicy, leaving us to speculate there's rye in the mash.","post_title":"Rogue 21st Anniversary","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"348-revision-3","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-10-19 14:48:27","post_modified_gmt":"2010-10-19 18:48:27","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"348","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/10\/348-revision-3\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The boys in Escondido created an \"Emperial IPA,\" or a double imperial IPA to celebrate 14 years.\r\n\r\nThe aroma isn't too hoppy, especially for what you'd expect out of the style, but what hops are discernible are of a sweeter variety.\r\n\r\nIn the flavor, however, it's all hops (in multiple senses).

I generally find them too cloying and light on actual beer flavor. While there are a TON of examples of great fruit beers, there are certainly many that just don't cut it.\r\n\r\nThis one avoided the filter by having its base beer be a Black Ale. Black Ales are one of my favorite styles, and I couldn't imagine a way that the addition of a bit of berry flavor could completely dominate the roasted malt and burnt acridity that comes with a Black Ale. Here's how William's Brothers describe Ebulum:\r\n<blockquote>Introduced to Scotland by Welsh druids in the 9th Century, elderberry black ale was part of the Celtic Autumn festivals when the \"elders\" would make this strong ale and pass the drink round the people of the village. The recipe was taken from a 16th Century record of domestic drinking in the Scottish Highlands. Elderberries were used for many natural remedies to cure sciatica, other forms of neuralgia, influenza and rhumatism as they contain tannins and fruit oils. Ebulum is made from roasted oats, barley and wheat boiled with herbs then fermented with ripe elderberries.<\/blockquote>\r\nI can enjoy a bit of anthropological brewing, especially when it falls right in a style that I really enjoy.\r\n\r\nEbulum pours a dark brown with mocha-brown head that lasted only seconds. Fruit dominates the nose with roasted malts coming through underneath with some caramels and burnt sugar.\r\n\r\nThere is a fruit sweetness up front which is quickly covered by a deep roast malt flavor, flowing into a nice acrid bite. There's a lingering berry flavor without any sort of cloying sweetness. Very nice. The beer is smooth without being very heavy with a nice, crisp carbonation.\r\n\r\nOverall, a very nice beer. I'm usually not one for fruit beers, but the roasted, acrid notes work really well to cut the cloying sweetness you sometimes end up with in a fruit beer.","post_title":"Review: William's Brothers Ebulum","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"review-williams-brothers-ebulum","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-08 20:25:44","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-09 01:25:44","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=523","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Fortunately, I checked the event details early enough to realize that it was in the Lincoln Park Binny's.

I decided this was a moment to celebrate, so I stopped at <a title=\"Binny's Beverage Depot\" href=\"http:\/\/binnys.com\" target=\"_blank\">Binny's<\/a> to pick up celebration supplies. As I was perusing the aisles, The Kaiser caught my eye (largely because it was on sale for $5.99!). I, for some reason, tend to skip over Avery beers while buying bottles. I think it's mainly because of the label art, which may be one of the stupidest possible reasons, but there it is.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I really liked the concept of an Imperial Oktoberfest, especially on one of the early, cool nights in October. I also really liked The Kaiser as a name for an Imperial Oktoberfest. <a title=\"Avery Brewing\" href=\"http:\/\/www.averybrewing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Avery Brewing<\/a> describes it:\r\n<blockquote>The Kaiser once said, \"Give me a woman who loves beer and I will conquer the world.\" If the Kaiser and his significant other had tipped this bottle, we'd all be \"sprechenden Deutsch!\" We took all that is good in a traditional Oktoberfest - gorgeous, deep copper sheen, massive malty backbone and spicy, floral, pungent noble hops - then intensified each into this, an Imperial Oktoberfest.<\/blockquote>\r\nMy tasting notes:\r\n\r\nAppearance: Extremely clear copper with a very thin, cream colored head that dissipated quickly.\r\n\r\nAroma: Dominated by molasses with caramel notes and a bit of pumpkin.\r\n\r\nTaste: Tons of malt. Caramel in the beginning flowing into a vegetal, pumpkin flavor with warming phenolic notes at the end.\r\n\r\nMouthfeel: Coating and chewy.\r\n\r\nOverall: Perfect for a cool night when I only want a beer a two. The alcohol will keep me warm, and the complexity of the malt flavor keeps it interesting. Also, I enjoy tasting a lager that has this heavy of a mouthfeel.

As it turned out, a great time was had by all. Even though I didn't learn much about the brewing process (aside from \"this is what enormous versions of brewing equipment look like\"), I enjoyed it.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_526\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"This artistic treehouse is outside the entrance to Dogfish Head.

Traffic getting into and out of Philadelphia was a hassle, even though we were traveling at non-peak times, and Delaware – apparently unaware that it is, in fact, Delaware – had some surprisingly bad traffic. I would recommend making a weekend trip of it, and spending some time at the beach in Delaware. The brewpub in Rehoboth Beach (which I unfortunately was unable to visit) has tastings on Thursday nights, and you can easily take the main brewery tour in Milton on Thursday or Friday afternoon.\r\n<h3>The Brewery<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_527\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Dogfish Head Beer Availability Calendar\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0514.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-527\" title=\"Dogfish Head Availability Calendar\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0514-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Head Availability Calendar\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe year-round beers for 2010 are 90-Minute, 60-Minute, Raison D’Etre, Indian Brown Ale, Midas Touch, and Palo Santo Marron. I've cut off the bottom of the poster, but there are several more brews listed. There are seasonal beers, limited-release beers, and much more.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_529\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Whiskey Barrels used for aging\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0515.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-529 \" title=\"Dogfish Head Whiskey Barrels\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0515-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Head Whiskey Barrels\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\nThese whiskey barrels were labeled as coming from Old Granddad Distillery, but actually had a wine-line scent on the inside, and I'm not sure if they were ever used to age whiskey. They were used to age an upcoming beer that was made in collaboration with 3 Floyds Brewery in Indiana (outside of Chicago). The tour guide didn't know a whole lot about the specifics of the beer, but has tried some, and said it's delicious. From what I could dig up on the internet, the <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2010\/09\/poppaskull-dogfish-head-three-floyds-collaboration-on-the-horizon\/\">Poppaskull<\/a> is a Belgian golden ale. It was supposed to come out in October, but hasn't quite been released yet. If I see it in any stores, I'll certainly check it out.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_530\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Brewpot (20,000 gallon, if I recall correctly) and a holding vessel that the hot wort is transferred into during the cooling process\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0520.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-530\" title=\"Dogfish Head Brewpot from afar\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0520-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Head Brewpot from afar\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDogfish Head uses a counterflow chilling system, but obviously on a much larger scale than that used by homebrewers.

This system is capable of 14-gallon (half-barrel) batches, and the current infrastructure at Dogfish Head produces around 100,000 barrels of beer each year.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_533\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"The entirety of the original Dogfish Head Brewery\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0519.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-533\" title=\"The entirety of the original Dogfish Head Brewery\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0519-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"The entirety of the original Dogfish Head Brewery\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe fermentation “cellar” isn’t much of a cellar, as it’s on the ground level along with the brew room.

The 90-Minute is a standard IPA with citrus and pine hops. It’s fairly bitter, but the hops are more notable in the aroma and the flavor. The Indian Brown Ale is a three-way blend between a Scotch Ale, a Brown Ale, and an IPA. It tastes pretty much like you’d expect, as a slightly fuller-flavored brown. There isn’t as much hop flavor or bitterness as I expected, and it had the dry finish that you expect from an American Brown Ale.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_537\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Yeah, I took an artsy photo.\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0526.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-537\" title=\"Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0526-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Olde School Barleywine is a strong beer at 15%, and is mostly what you'd expect from a good barleywine. As a lover of the style, I had no complaints with this beer. Not particularly bitter or hoppy to balance out the malt flavors, but there was some fruit flavor in there. It had a thick, almost viscous texture, and the alcohol was definitely apparent in the nose and taste. The alcohol flavor wasn't overwhelming, especially given the high ABV, and this was an all-around enjoyable brew.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_538\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0528.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-538\" title=\"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0528-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Santo Marron is an interesting taste, and the wood-aged qualities are a little distinctive due to the unique wood used. The beer is pictured in front of one of the staves of Palo Santo wood that was cut to create the barrel. Though this piece wasn't used, identical ones compose the enormous barrel seen above. This bad boy was surprisingly heavy, probably around 15 pounds despite only being a couple feet long.","post_title":"Brewery Tour: Dogfish Head","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"brewery-tour-dogfish-head","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-01 19:22:49","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-01 23:22:49","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=524","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

With me on my trip, I brought two canned brews from Keweenaw Brewing Company. Over recent years, microbreweries have been switching to canned beer for several reasons. Cans are cheaper to produce, more environmentally friendly\/recyclable, and, for the consumer, often more convenient.\r\n\r\nThese beers came in standard 6-pack plastic duck traps. I liked the design of the cans, which, when giving up the aesthetics of a bottle, is at least something to consider. The two we had were the Widow Maker Black Ale, and the Lift Bridge Brown Ale.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_501\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Canned Black and Brown ales\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/IMG_20101022_230520.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-501 \" title=\"Cans\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/IMG_20101022_230520-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Kewanaw Brewing\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWe'll start with the black ale. Let me first say this: Ow. I felt like I was drinking tinfoil. 100% of the aroma was metal. No hops, no malt, just metal. It gave me a pain at the base of my skull just sniffing it. The flavor was little better. Metal again was the dominant force in the mouth, with a few nutty malt notes, but little else. It was over-carbonated, and had the texture of Sprite. Paul and I fought over who had to finish it.\r\n\r\nThe brown ale was a little better, but, well, not normal. Here, the metal was significantly reduced, and the nose had a noticeable malt aroma, with a few notes of chocolate. The head was extremely frothy, almost milky, and mixed with the chocolate malt notes, gave it a strange milk chocolate taste. This, strangely, didn't translate to the heavy body you'd expect, and left me feeling confused. As with the black, there was almost no hop aroma or flavor, and while the metallic taste was less than the black, it was still there, scraping across my tastebuds.\r\n\r\nNow, I don't want to come out and say all canned beers are bad and metallic and damn close to undrinkable, but, wow: D+ would not buy again.

In the post I said I would probably get the Brrbon which is a bourbon barrel aged winter warmer, but standing there in the store with one bottle being $7.99 and the other $12.99, economy won out. The slick frosted black finish on the bottle certainly didn't hurt at all.\r\n\r\nI usually don't read reviews of beers online before tasting it myself because I don't want to biased. With this one, I wanted to tell a friend which beer I was drinking, and the easiest way was to just hop onto <a href=\"http:\/\/ratebeer.com\" target=\"_blank\">RateBeer.com<\/a> and link the page. While on there, I skimmed some of the lower review. Some, like this one, weren't very positive:\r\n<blockquote>Big ass, hot, malt bomb. Alcohol very, very upfront with no balance forethought. Might be nice to lay down, but now is very offensive.<\/blockquote>\r\nI was undeterred. I like to think I have a very accepting palate, and there's a certain enjoyment in drinking a beer that is largely independent of the beer, especially when it involves experimentation and discovery. So, I tried my best not be biased while writing down these tasting notes:\r\n<blockquote><\/blockquote>\r\nPours an amber gold with tan, cream head that disappears quickly.\r\n\r\nTons of roasted malt in the nose with spiciness coming from the alcohol, but it's not unpleasant. Little to no hops, but that seems to be by design.\r\n\r\nThe taste is incredibly complex and comes in about three waves. The first is a spice mix of maybe coriander and ginger. This is followed by an intense malt sweetness that would almost be cloying if it were not for be being cut by a burning alcohol taste.\r\n\r\nThe beer feels like it has a ton of malt, and is smooth, but it is certainly not heavy.\r\n\r\nThere is a lingering, coating mix of malt and alcohol. Almost like a burning sensation on the tongue.\r\n\r\nI actually really enjoyed this beer. The alcohol warmth was almost like what you'd get with a spirit, but that seemed totally appropriate for something that purports to be a warmer. The taste beyond the alcohol was complex and came at me in waves. If I were to get it again, I would split the bomber with a friend, because I got a little too buzzed off the one bottle for just a relaxed tasting.\r\n\r\nThis beer isn't for everyone. If you don't mind the alcohol burn, this beer shows how complex and interesting a beer that focuses on the malt can be.","post_title":"Beer Review: Red Hook Eisbock 28","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"beer-review-red-hook-eisbock-28","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-05 10:59:07","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-05 14:59:07","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=512","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

An ale with a Scottish flavor, the name seems to foreshadow that, though Fouch Hill is actually located in Northern Michigan, on the Leelenau Peninsula near Traverse City.\n\nAnyway, onto the beer. The aroma is very light, with almost no hint of hops, and mostly a peaty scent (again, reminiscent of imports from Scotland). I could do with a bit more aroma there, actually.\n\nThe flavor itself is heavily peat-y, almost something straight out of Scotland, with almost no hint of traditional flavoring hops. There are roasty malts a-plenty, along with a decent alcohol flavor - belying this session beer's 4.8% ABV. A sweet, malty flavor persists throughout.\n\nThe color is a deep caramel, though the beer is a little more transparent than you'd expect from the style. The mouthfeel is a little light for the expectation from the flavor, though it sticks around a bit after swallowing. The carbonation is a little lacking, but that's more likely a service issue than one from the brewing process.\n\nThere are a few (minor) deficiencies with this beer, but in all honesty, it's the best craft brew I've had in at least a few weeks. I'll be glad to have it as long as it's on tap at Grizzly Peak.","post_title":"Grizzly Peak Fouch Hill Dark Ale","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"486-revision-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-10-21 15:15:55","post_modified_gmt":"2010-10-21 19:15:55","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"486","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/10\/486-revision-2\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

I'm not sure I'd pick this up again, but it was a fun adventure.","post_title":"Beer Review: Ska Brewing Nefarious Ten Pin","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"472-autosave","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-10-27 20:19:23","post_modified_gmt":"2010-10-28 00:19:23","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"472","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/10\/472-autosave\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

(Now, you can synthesize ethanol, industrially, through the hydration of ethylene, but this involves using some nasty chemicals that don't belong in something you plan on drinking.) Yeast, as you probably know, eats sugars in your beer and (as Tim likes to put it) poop out alcohol.\n\nYeast is a single-cell fungus, which is found just about everywhere. All types of yeast reproduce asexually, though there is a process of genetic material exchange between cells. The yeast species you are probably most familier with is <em>saccharomyces cerevisiae<\/em>, ale yeast. This is actually the same specie as baking yeast, but in general, brewers use a less aggressive yeast strain that produces fewer unwanted chemicals that would give the beer an undesireable taste.<em> Saccharomyces carlsbergenis<\/em>, called so because it was first isolated by Carlsberg, also known as <em>saccharomyces pastorianus<\/em> or lager yeast, is, unshockingly, used in lagers. Saccharomyces carlsbergenis is a combination of saccharomyces cerevisiae and a third type of yeast, used mostly in wine and ciders, saccharomyces bayanus.\n\nThe thing most important for your beer that you need to know about the differences in these yeasts is that lager yeast generally has higher attenuation, meaning it can eat more sugars, leaving your beer more dry (though the variation in strains of each lager and ale yeast provides a large overlap), and that it works at a colder temperature (about 10-15 F colder) than ale yeast.\n\nAll alcohol-producing yeast can work in two different ways, based on if there is oxygen around or not. When yeast eats sugars without oxygen, the yeast gives off the waste of ethanol, and carbon dioxide, along with some energy. This energy does two things, it powers the yeast cell, so it can grow, and warms the liquid it is in. When there is oxygen present, the yeast cell can completely break down the sugar into water and carbon dioxide. This produces significanly more energy for the yeast cell, which lets it grow much faster.\n\nWhen you add your yeast to your wort, you want some oxygen to rapidly grow your yeast so fermentation doesn't take a long time. Once the yeast has consumed all the oxygen in the wort, it then switches to anarobic fermentation (without oxygen) and makes ethanol. If you have a large quantity of yeast cells to start with, you don't have to oxygenate your wort as much, and you'll get higher alcohol concentrations (and less water) in your beer.\n\nAnother stat you may see on the side of your yeast pack is 'flocculation'. Flocculation means the 'clumping' of yeast cells in your beer. This sounds like it might be a bad thing, but actually it's good. When your yeast cells are done eating sugars, they can do one of two things: with yeast that has a low flocculation, it will just sit suspended in the beer. High flocculation means the cells will clump together and float to the top, in the case of ale yeast, or sink to the bottom, in the case of lager yeast. This will make your beer clearer. Some beer styles are traditionally cloudy with yeast, and has a slightly different taste because of it.\n\nSome of you may notice I didn't mention <em>brettanomyces<\/em>, a genus of yeast used in making lambics. This yeast is naturally found in the air in the southwest of Belgium. Lambics are made, not by adding yeast directly to the wort, but by allowing them open access to the air. The yeast particles in the air fall into the beer, instead of physically putting a yeast solution into the beer. This yeast gives lambics a distinctive sour taste. This open fermentation, you might think, wouldn't work, because it isn't separated from the air. If the wort is exposed to the air, it will have access to oxygen, and the yeast would never anaerobicly ferment the sugars into ethanol. However, if you remember part of what is released is carbon dioxide. CO2 is heavier than air and sits on top of the wort, creating a barrier between the oxygen in the air and the wort, allowing fermentation.\n\nThere are many different strains of each of these species of yeast. Each have slightly different characteristics that will produce slightly different results. More or less flocculation, more or less attenuation, higher or lower prefered fermentation temperatures, etc. These allow you to fine tune your beer, in a general sense, the important distinguishing factor is ale yeast, lager yeast, or lambic yeast.

This barrel should be in use for approximately 20 years.\n<h3>The Tasting<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"attachment_536\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Tim tasting at Dogfish Head Brewery\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0523.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-536 \" title=\"Tasting at Dogfish Head Brewery\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0523-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Tasting at Dogfish Head Brewery\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nAfter spending all my energy on the tour (not really), it was time to relax and try a couple free samples in the on-site pub\/gift shop.\n\nThe four beers that were available for free samples were the 90-Minute IPA, the Indian Brown Ale, the Olde School Barleywine, and Palo Santo Marron.\n\nSince the 90-Minute and Indian Brown are standard Dogfish Head brews that you can get pretty much anywhere, I won’t spend too much effort talking about them. The 90-Minute is a standard IPA with citrus and pine hops. It’s fairly bitter, but the hops are more notable in the aroma and the flavor. The Indian Brown Ale is a three-way blend between a Scotch Ale, a Brown Ale, and an IPA. It tastes pretty much like you’d expect, as a slightly fuller-flavored brown. There isn’t as much hop flavor or bitterness as I expected, and it had the dry finish that you expect from an American Brown Ale.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_537\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Yeah, I took an artsy photo.\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0526.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-537\" title=\"Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0526-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nThe Olde School Barleywine is a strong beer at 15%, and is mostly what you'd expect from a good barleywine. As a lover of the style, I had no complaints with this beer. Not particularly bitter or hoppy to balance out the malt flavors, but there was some fruit flavor in there. It had a thick, almost viscous texture, and the alcohol was definitely apparent in the nose and taste. The alcohol flavor wasn't overwhelming, especially given the high ABV, and this was an all-around enjoyable brew.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_538\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0528.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-538\" title=\"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0528-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nThe Palo Santo Marron is an interesting taste, and the wood-aged qualities are a little distinctive due to the unique wood used. The beer is pictured in front of one of the staves of Palo Santo wood that was cut to create the barrel. Though this piece wasn't used, identical ones compose the enormous barrel seen above. This bad boy was surprisingly heavy, probably around 15 pounds despite only being a couple feet long.","post_title":"Brewery Tour: Dogfish Head","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"524-revision","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-01 19:01:11","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-01 23:01:11","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"524","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/11\/524-revision\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The 90-Minute is a standard IPA with citrus and pine hops. It’s fairly bitter, but the hops are more notable in the aroma and the flavor. The Indian Brown Ale is a three-way blend between a Scotch Ale, a Brown Ale, and an IPA. It tastes pretty much like you’d expect, as a slightly fuller-flavored brown. There isn’t as much hop flavor or bitterness as I expected, and it had the dry finish that you expect from an American Brown Ale.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_537\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Yeah, I took an artsy photo.\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0526.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-537\" title=\"Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0526-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Olde School Barleywine is a strong beer at 15%, and is mostly what you'd expect from a good barleywine. As a lover of the style, I had no complaints with this beer. Not particularly bitter or hoppy to balance out the malt flavors, but there was some fruit flavor in there. It had a thick, almost viscous texture, and the alcohol was definitely apparent in the nose and taste. The alcohol flavor wasn't overwhelming, especially given the high ABV, and this was an all-around enjoyable brew.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_538\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0528.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-538\" title=\"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0528-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Santo Marron is an interesting taste, and the wood-aged qualities are a little distinctive due to the unique wood used. The beer is pictured in front of one of the staves of Palo Santo wood that was cut to create the barrel. Though this piece wasn't used, identical ones compose the enormous barrel seen above. This bad boy was surprisingly heavy, probably around 15 pounds despite only being a couple feet long.","post_title":"Brewery Tour: Dogfish Head","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"524-revision-5","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-01 19:10:26","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-01 23:10:26","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"524","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/11\/524-revision-5\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The 90-Minute is a standard IPA with citrus and pine hops. It’s fairly bitter, but the hops are more notable in the aroma and the flavor. The Indian Brown Ale is a three-way blend between a Scotch Ale, a Brown Ale, and an IPA. It tastes pretty much like you’d expect, as a slightly fuller-flavored brown. There isn’t as much hop flavor or bitterness as I expected, and it had the dry finish that you expect from an American Brown Ale.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_537\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Yeah, I took an artsy photo.\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0526.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-537\" title=\"Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0526-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Olde School Barleywine is a strong beer at 15%, and is mostly what you'd expect from a good barleywine. As a lover of the style, I had no complaints with this beer. Not particularly bitter or hoppy to balance out the malt flavors, but there was some fruit flavor in there. It had a thick, almost viscous texture, and the alcohol was definitely apparent in the nose and taste. The alcohol flavor wasn't overwhelming, especially given the high ABV, and this was an all-around enjoyable brew.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_538\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0528.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-538\" title=\"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0528-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Santo Marron is an interesting taste, and the wood-aged qualities are a little distinctive due to the unique wood used. The beer is pictured in front of one of the staves of Palo Santo wood that was cut to create the barrel. Though this piece wasn't used, identical ones compose the enormous barrel seen above. This bad boy was surprisingly heavy, probably around 15 pounds despite only being a couple feet long.","post_title":"Brewery Tour: Dogfish Head","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"524-revision-3","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-01 19:01:58","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-01 23:01:58","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"524","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/11\/524-revision-3\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The 90-Minute is a standard IPA with citrus and pine hops. It’s fairly bitter, but the hops are more notable in the aroma and the flavor. The Indian Brown Ale is a three-way blend between a Scotch Ale, a Brown Ale, and an IPA. It tastes pretty much like you’d expect, as a slightly fuller-flavored brown. There isn’t as much hop flavor or bitterness as I expected, and it had the dry finish that you expect from an American Brown Ale.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_537\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Yeah, I took an artsy photo.\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0526.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-537\" title=\"Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0526-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Olde School Barleywine is a strong beer at 15%, and is mostly what you'd expect from a good barleywine.

It had a thick, almost viscous texture, and the alcohol was definitely apparent in the nose and taste. The alcohol flavor wasn't overwhelming, especially given the high ABV, and this was an all-around enjoyable brew.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_538\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0528.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-538\" title=\"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0528-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Santo Marron is an interesting taste, and the wood-aged qualities are a little distinctive due to the unique wood used.

{"ID":"546","post_author":"2","post_date":"2010-11-01 19:11:05","post_date_gmt":"2010-11-01 23:11:05","post_content":"[caption id=\"attachment_525\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Dogfish Head is the 16th-largest craft brewer in America, located in Milton, Delaware\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-525 \" title=\"Dogfish Head\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0529-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Head Craft Brewery\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOn my recent vacation to Philadelphia, I took a day trip down to Milton to get my first tour of a bigtime -- or medium-time, as it were -- brewery. As it turned out, a great time was had by all. Even though I didn't learn much about the brewing process (aside from \"this is what enormous versions of brewing equipment look like\"), I enjoyed it.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_526\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"This artistic treehouse is outside the entrance to Dogfish Head.

Traffic getting into and out of Philadelphia was a hassle, even though we were traveling at non-peak times, and Delaware – apparently unaware that it is, in fact, Delaware – had some surprisingly bad traffic. I would recommend making a weekend trip of it, and spending some time at the beach in Delaware. The brewpub in Rehoboth Beach (which I unfortunately was unable to visit) has tastings on Thursday nights, and you can easily take the main brewery tour in Milton on Thursday or Friday afternoon.\r\n<h3>The Brewery<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_527\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Dogfish Head Beer Availability Calendar\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0514.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-527\" title=\"Dogfish Head Availability Calendar\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0514-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Head Availability Calendar\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe year-round beers for 2010 are 90-Minute, 60-Minute, Raison D’Etre, Indian Brown Ale, Midas Touch, and Palo Santo Marron. I've cut off the bottom of the poster, but there are several more brews listed. There are seasonal beers, limited-release beers, and much more.\r\n\r\nThese whiskey barrels were labeled as coming from Old Granddad Distillery, but actually had a wine-line scent on the inside, and I'm not sure if they were ever used to age whiskey. They were used to age an upcoming beer that was made in collaboration with 3 Floyds Brewery in Indiana (outside of Chicago). The tour guide didn't know a whole lot about the specifics of the beer, but has tried some, and said it's delicious. From what I could dig up on the internet, the <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2010\/09\/poppaskull-dogfish-head-three-floyds-collaboration-on-the-horizon\/\">Poppaskull<\/a> is a Belgian golden ale.

Their recipe is undoubtedly different than our own was (in no small part because it was one of our first few batches, and we didn't quiiiite know what we were doing yet).\n\nWhile Short's used actual graham crackers and marshmallows in their brew, we went for facsimiles like biscuit malt, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Despite the different processes, the flavor is almost a clone. Cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla, maybe a bit of honey. The body was a little lighter than I'd expect out of the style (I guess \"S'more Porter\" doesn't quite have the same ring to it), but the color was damn near black.\n\nThe differences between their beer and ours come mostly in the clean finish of the professional version, in no small part because we were still working our way through the brewing process at the time we made our s'more stout. However, having a commercially-brewed version of the beer inspired us enough to make a new batch, starting from sratch with the recipe.","post_title":"Short's Brew S'more Stout","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"390-revision-6","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-04 11:19:39","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-04 15:19:39","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"390","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/11\/390-revision-6\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

In the post I said I would probably get the Brrbon which is a bourbon barrel aged winter warmer, but standing there in the store with one bottle being $7.99 and the other $12.99, economy won out. The slick frosted black finish on the bottle certainly didn't hurt at all.\n\nI usually don't read reviews of beers online before tasting it myself because I don't want to biased. With this one, I wanted to tell a friend which beer I was drinking, and the easiest way was to just hop onto <a href=\"http:\/\/ratebeer.com\" target=\"_blank\">RateBeer.com<\/a> and link the page. While on there, I skimmed some of the lower review. Some, like this one, weren't very positive:\n<blockquote>Big ass, hot, malt bomb. Alcohol very, very upfront with no balance forethought. Might be nice to lay down, but now is very offensive.<\/blockquote>\nI was undeterred. I like to think I have a very accepting palate, and there's a certain enjoyment in drinking a beer that is largely independent of the beer, especially when it involves experimentation and discovery. So, I tried my best not be biased while writing down these tasting notes:\n\nPours an amber gold with tan, cream head that disappears quickly.\n\nTons of roasted malt in the nose with spiciness coming from the alcohol, but it's not unpleasant. Little to no hops, but that seems to be by design.\n\nThe taste is incredibly complex and comes in about three waves. The first is a spice mix of maybe coriander and ginger.

Almost like a burning sensation on the tongue.\n\nI actually really enjoyed this beer. The alcohol warmth was almost like what you'd get with a spirit, but that seemed totally appropriate for something that purports to be a warmer. The taste beyond the alcohol was complex and came at me in waves. If I were to get it again, I would split the bomber with a friend, because I got a little too buzzed off the one bottle for just a relaxed tasting.\n\nThis beer isn't for everyone. If you don't mind the alcohol burn, this beer shows how complex and interesting a beer that focuses on the malt can be.","post_title":"Beer Review: Red Hook Eisbock 28","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"512-autosave","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-05 11:00:12","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-05 15:00:12","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"512","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/11\/512-autosave\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Here's how William's Brothers describe Ebulum:\n<blockquote>Introduced to Scotland by Welsh druids in the 9th Century, elderberry black ale was part of the Celtic Autumn festivals when the \"elders\" would make this strong ale and pass the drink round the people of the village. The recipe was taken from a 16th Century record of domestic drinking in the Scottish Highlands. Elderberries were used for many natural remedies to cure sciatica, other forms of neuralgia, influenza and rhumatism as they contain tannins and fruit oils. Ebulum is made from roasted oats, barley and wheat boiled with herbs then fermented with ripe elderberries.<\/blockquote>\nI can enjoy a bit of anthropological brewing, especially when it falls right in a style that I really enjoy.\n\nEbulum pours a dark brown with mocha-brown head that lasted only seconds. Fruit dominates the nose with roasted malts coming through underneath with some caramels and burnt sugar.\n\nThere is a fruit sweetness up front which is quickly covered by a deep roast malt flavor, flowing into a nice acrid bite. There's a lingering berry flavor without any sort of cloying sweetness. Very nice. The beer is smooth without being very heavy with a nice, crisp carbonation.\n\nOverall, a very nice beer. I'm usually not one for fruit beers, but the roasted, acrid notes work really well to cut the cloying sweetness you sometimes end up with in a fruit beer.","post_title":"Review: William's Brothers Ebulum","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"523-autosave","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-08 20:26:48","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-09 01:26:48","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"523","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/11\/523-autosave\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

It definitely leans toward the sweetness than the acridity.\n\nThere's a slight off taste which I assume comes from an imported beer being bottled in clear glass. This is something I don't get at all. Why wouldn't you want to protect your beer? Anyway, beyond a bit of a lightstruck taste, the flavor is dominated by a smooth molasses that coats the mouth. It finishes with some caramel and a few acrid notes.\n\nThe beer is nice and chewy. It coats the mouth as it goes down. It has kind of  a bright carbonation that helps it from being too overwhelming.\n\nI'm pretty sure this would have been a perfectly delightful stout had it been bottled in a dark glass bottle.","post_title":"Review: Bellhaven Scottish Stout","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"564-revision","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-08 21:53:38","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-09 02:53:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"564","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/11\/564-revision\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

I knew it had tomato flavors, but that was the extent of my knowledge.\n\nFirst sip: Celery. Dill Salt. Cracked Peppercorns.\n\nAh ha! \"Bloody\" is short for Bloody Mary, the breakfast of champions (where \"champions\" here refers to those who wake up with a hangover). With that in mind, I continued to drink on.\n\nTomato, celery, and salt are the three overwhelming flavors of the Bloody Beer, even moreso than any particular beer standards like hops or malt. In fact, it's hard to taste more than the slightest hints that this is a beer at all. More than anything, it's almost like a blonde-colored, watered-down, carbonated bloody mary than anything. It even has a little of the viscosity of tomato juice, which is a different consistency than you'd get from a beer.\n\nAs a beer, I would say it's below average for those reasons. As a beverage, it's certainly interesting enough to try once or twice. I split the bottle with someone, and don't know if I could handle the flavors for an entire 12 ounces. It's an interesting beer to mix with others, because it can add a lot of flavors that you won't get from damn near anything you mix with it.","post_title":"Beer Review: Short's Bloody Beer","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"411-revision-4","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-10 16:34:57","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-10 21:34:57","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"411","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/11\/411-revision-4\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

viscous as motor oil and full of chocolate, bourbon, and coffee.  The clear winner on the night.  I still prefer the KBS overall (I think the flavors are a little more complex), but this is ever so close.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dark Horse Plead the 5th<\/strong>\r\nRussian Imperial Stout - Globe-shaped sampler glass\r\n\r\nThe lightest RIS I've ever encountered.  It pours brown and translucent with no real head by the time it was served.  A whiff of alcohol on the nose, not much more in terms of scent, it has a smooth mouthfeel with tastes of dark chocolate and a strong whisky finish.\r\n\r\n<strong>Goose Island Imperial Brown Goose<\/strong>\r\nOld Ale - Globe-shaped sampler glass\r\n\r\nPours dark brown with a persistent, thin off-white head.  Goose Island blended their 2004 and 2005 Christmas ales and aged them in 4-year-old Jim Beam and 12-year-old Heaven Hill bourbon barrels, and I can detect cinnamon and nutmeg among other spices alongside a mellow bourbon flavor.\r\n\r\n<strong>Great Divide Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout<\/strong>\r\nRussian Imperial Stout - Globe-shaped sampler glass\r\n\r\nIt smells like a beer, but tastes STRONGLY of charcoal smoke.  Must be the oak chips it's been aged with, giving it a burnt flavor that lingers for a long time after the vanilla flavors fade away.\r\n\r\n<strong>Avery Samael's Ale<\/strong>\r\nEnglish Barleywine - Globe-shaped sampler glass\r\n\r\nIt tastes sweet and light, but packs a 14.5% ABV wallop and finishes with cinnamon and nutmeg.\r\n\r\n<strong>Founders Backwoods Bastard<\/strong>\r\nWe Heavy Scotch Ale - Globe-shaped sampler glass\r\n\r\nYou can taste the Dirty Bastard under it all, but to me it tastes more like Devil Dancer than anything else.  It has that same way about it where it hits like a sledgehammer and lingers.\r\n\r\n<strong>Founders Black Biscuit<\/strong>\r\nOld Ale - Tulip glass\r\n\r\nThe pour overflowed the glass on the way over and now my hands smell like beer and chocolate.  Black Biscuit has a thin but persistently full head and pours thick and black.  This is a black old ale aged in bourbon barrels, and the chocolate, bourbon, and roasted malt flavors dominate.  It's not quite as huge or complex as a bourbon stout, but the tradeoff is that it's more drinkable.  Definitely give this one a try if you have the chance.\r\n\r\n<strong>Atwater Barrel Aged Cherry Stout Firkin<\/strong>\r\nStout - Globe-shaped sampler glass\r\n\r\nTastes like black cherries soaked in bourbon and dropped into a stout, but not overpowering the stout base.  I'm not a big fan of fruit beers, but I can see myself ordering this as a a full pour.","post_title":"Guest Post: Hopcat Tasting Event","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"guest-post-hopcat-tasting-event","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-29 13:11:27","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-29 18:11:27","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=617","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Foodies may recognize the name Masaharu Morimoto as an Iron Chef. The main reason for this lunch trip was to have a high-end ramen noodle dish - which apparently exists - but when the menu also had a quartet of Morimoto-branded ales brewed by Rogue, I couldn't pass up trying them all in a flight.\r\n<h4>Black Obi Soba Ale<\/h4>\r\nThis beer (and the base Soba Ale) are both brewed with soba, a buckwheat-based malt that is common in Asian cuisine, but this one added some specialty malts to give more body and flavor. This beer reminded me of a black ale, as the mouthfeel and appearance were incongruous. It was overly dry tasting to me, and I was not a huge fan.\r\n<h4>Hazelnut Brown Ale<\/h4>\r\nThis had a more sweet, nutty flavor of hazelnut than a lot of standard hazelnut browns, which was the most notable facet of it. It was the thickest feeling and tasting of the three beers, and probably the best overall on its own merits.\r\n<h4>Imperial Pilsner<\/h4>\r\nThe waitress described this as \"like our IPA,\" about which I was skeptical, because in no world does an Imperial Pilsner seem like it should be described as such. I was right, she was wrong. This beer had a very light body, and a sweet flavor. As you can (kind of) see in the picture, it's got a little opacity, but it's straight pilsner in flavor.\r\n\r\nIt's got the sweet hints you'd expect out of the classic czech pilsners, with maybe a more extreme sweetness, which the \"imperial\" portion would lead you to expect. While I'm an established lager\/pilsner-hater at times, I actually thought this was one of the better beers in the flight, and it went particularly well with the salty food dish.\r\n<h4>Soba Ale<\/h4>\r\nAs mentioned above, this was brewed with malted soba. It was a standard ale with a few distinct flavors from the soba, but nothing special. It had a fairly dry flavor itself.\r\n<h4>Overall<\/h4>\r\nI'm a fan of Rogue beers, but these... well, they just didn't do it for me. They are brewed for a specific use (branding with the Morimoto name), and they're mediocre enough that I wouldn't bother to try another Morimoto-branded beer unless it came specifically recommended to me - despite being crafted by a respected brewer.","post_title":"Review: Rogue Morimoto Flight","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"review-rogue-morimoto-flight","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-18 08:13:45","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-18 13:13:45","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=589","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

One such product is a Peruvian import: Cusqueña. Cusquena is produced by the Backus &amp; Johnston Brewery, <a href=\"http:\/\/findarticles.com\/p\/articles\/mi_m0OQC\/is_4_3\/ai_100463052\/\">acquired in 2002<\/a> by Grupo Empresarial Bavaria, an international subsidiary of SABMiller.\n\nThe Backus website (¡Aviso! en Español) gives <a href=\"http:\/\/www.backus.com.pe\/WB.WebSite\/cusquena.html\">insight into the beer itself<\/a>. I'll translate for you:\n<blockquote>Cusqueña offers pure and internationally recognized fine flavor that makes us proud of the quality of Peruvian products, to be made with 100% pure barley and Saaz hops, the finest in the world.<\/blockquote>\nTheir UK website gives <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cusquena.co.uk\/home\/\">a little more detail<\/a>, including the fact that they use melt water from 18,000 feet high in the Andes, a marketing tip SABMiller must have learned from their pals at Coors.\n\nFor a bit more on Cusqueña, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anaperuana.com\/2009\/03\/09\/cusquena-and-other-famous-beers-of-peru\/\">this blog post<\/a> I found. It comes with ads!\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"640\" height=\"505\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"src\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/QcvGPfM8K_8?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;hd=1\" \/><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><embed type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/QcvGPfM8K_8?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;hd=1\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/embed><\/object>\n\nTasting Notes\n\nFrom a visual standpoint, this might as well be a standard American light lager in an impostor's bottle. The body is not opaque or cloudy at all, the color is light, and the head is barely off-white, dissipating steadily.\n\nThe aroma is practically non-existent, with the standard bland smell you'd expect from an American light lager. The flavor is somewhat standard for a lager - except the beer is overly sweet, almost to a point of being sickening. I thought that was interesting, considering the beer boasts about using only barley (see above), and not flavorless adjuncts like corn and rice that you'd find in mass-produced American beers.\n\nOverall... I'm glad I tried this, because it's something new, I love to expand horizons, and I got to learn a little bit posting about it - but it's not something that I think I need to have again.","post_title":"Peru Brew: Cusqueña","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"peru-brew-cusquena","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-23 16:17:37","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-23 21:17:37","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=591","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The \"Order Here\" sign moving from the counter to suspended above it, for example, was a welcome change. As time goes on, I expect many more minor improvements like this to improve the experience for patrons (and employees, too).\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_608\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Seating Area\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0644.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-608\" title=\"Seating Area\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0644-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Seating Area\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_609\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Opening Day Menu\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0645.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-609\" title=\"Opening Day Menu\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0645-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Opening Day Menu\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe interior is quite spacious, with the bar running along the left side and the entire back wall. Behind the bar on the left side, you can usually peer through an open door into the brewery itself. The space is quite large, so hopefully there's room for future expansion. There are a couple TVs, though they're definitely not a focus of the bar. I'd be interested to check the place out during a Michigan sporting event, because it could be a decent sports bar. The decor is mostly dark, but there's a local focus as well, as the tables throughout the taphouse have nautical maps of the Great Lakes, and there's a large map of the state on the far right wall, near the dartboards (pictured above).\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_610\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Big House Brown\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0646.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-610\" title=\"Big House Brown\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0646-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Big House Brown\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThere's definitely potential for a new taphouse in Ann Arbor, especially one that's filling the previously-barren niche of focusing on lagers. Situated on the far West side, this is going to be a townie bar, with very rare appearances from students. Aside from that, Wolverine State Brewing Co. still seems to be looking for its identity, but that's something that can only come with time and establishing a customer base, and can't be artificially forced. Once the taphouse hits its stride, I have no doubts it will be very successful.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_611\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"A Glimpse into the Brewery\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0647.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-611 \" title=\"A Glimpse into the Brewery\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/IMG_0647-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"A Glimpse into the Brewery\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]","post_title":"Taphouse Opening: Wolverine State Brewing Co.","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"taphouse-opening-wolverine-state-brewing-co","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-12-07 12:16:33","post_modified_gmt":"2010-12-07 17:16:33","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=592","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

You can order a lot of different things online, and I can personally vouch for how friendly and knowledgeable their staff is. We actually got a bad lid on a refurbished Corny keg. We were looking at new lids, and they just told us to bring it in and they'd either fix it or replace it for free. It's a great site to order or your supplies, and it's even better to drop in and pull your own grain and sample what they have in their kegerator.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThis is by no way complete.

One such product is a Peruvian import: Cusqueña. Cusquena is produced by the Backus &amp; Johnston Brewery, <a href=\"http:\/\/findarticles.com\/p\/articles\/mi_m0OQC\/is_4_3\/ai_100463052\/\">acquired in 2002<\/a> by Grupo Empresarial Bavaria, an international subsidiary of SABMiller.\n\nThe Backus website (¡Aviso! en Español) gives <a href=\"http:\/\/www.backus.com.pe\/WB.WebSite\/cusquena.html\">insight into the beer itself<\/a>. I'll translate for you:\n<blockquote>Cusqueña offers pure and internationally recognized fine flavor that makes us proud of the quality of Peruvian products, to be made with 100% pure barley and Saaz hops, the finest in the world.<\/blockquote>\nTheir UK website gives <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cusquena.co.uk\/home\/\">a little more detail<\/a>, including the fact that they use melt water from 18,000 feet high in the Andes, a marketing tip SABMiller must have learned from their pals at Coors.\n\nFor a bit more on Cusqueña, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anaperuana.com\/2009\/03\/09\/cusquena-and-other-famous-beers-of-peru\/\">this blog post<\/a> I found.

The body is not opaque or cloudy at all, the color is light, and the head is barely off-white, dissipating steadily.\n\nThe aroma is practically non-existent, with the standard bland smell you'd expect from an American light lager. The flavor is somewhat standard for a lager - except the beer is overly sweet, almost to a point of being sickening. I thought that was interesting, considering the beer boasts about using only barley (see above), and not flavorless adjuncts like corn and rice that you'd find in mass-produced American beers.\n\nOverall... I'm glad I tried this, because it's something new, I love to expand horizons, and I got to learn a little bit posting about it - but it's not something that I think","post_title":"Peru Brew: Cusqueña","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"591-revision","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-17 15:23:02","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-17 20:23:02","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"591","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/11\/591-revision\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

I think part of it is that they have a feeling the ephemerality. Part of it is definitely that they often play to my love of puns. The biggest reason is that their flavor profiles are generally right up my alley. When I think of a winter warmer or holiday beer, I imagine malty, leaning toward sweet, maybe some interesting spice notes, and definitely a warmth from the alcohol. What about that doesn't sound great?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rogue.com\/\">Rogue<\/a>, living up to its name, rarely plays by the rules. This beer is not exception. It doesn't really fit my stereotype of winter seasonals. In describing it, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rogue.com\/beers\/santas-private-reserve.php\">Rogue says<\/a>:\r\n<blockquote>Rogue’s annual holiday offering, Santa’s Private Reserve, is a variation of the classic Saint Rogue Red, but with double the hops--including Chinook, and Centennial, and a mystery hop called Rudolph by head brewer John “more hops” Maier!<\/blockquote>\r\nWhen I think of ways to make something more of a holiday beer, I rarely think, \"Double the hops!\" But, just because it's not falling into my conceptions of what a holiday beer <em>should<\/em> be doesn't mean it can't be a great beer. I tried to approach this tasting as just a beer, not a holiday beer, but I fear my opinion may be colored by what I was hoping for.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #444444;\">Tasting Notes<\/span><\/h3>\r\nAppearance: Amber with hints of ruby red when held up to the light. It's topped with a 2-finger thick, off-white head  that deliberately came down to about half an inch.\r\n\r\nAroma: Caramel and aromatic malts combine for a solid sweetness with some green, earthy hop bitterness.\r\n\r\nTaste: A nice, creamy sweetness is quickly backed up by an assertive, balancing hop bitterness. You're left with a lingering, but not coating bitterness.\r\n\r\nMouthfeel: Light and bubbly without feeling watery.\r\n\r\nOverall: I could go for a bit more malt character and maybe a more piney hop bitterness in a winter seasonal. It's a good, but not remarkable beer.","post_title":"Review: Rouge Santa's Private Reserve","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"review-rouge-santas-private-reserve","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-12-13 11:42:40","post_modified_gmt":"2010-12-13 16:42:40","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=643","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

One such product is a Peruvian import: Cusqueña. Cusquena is produced by the Backus &amp; Johnston Brewery, <a href=\"http:\/\/findarticles.com\/p\/articles\/mi_m0OQC\/is_4_3\/ai_100463052\/\">acquired in 2002<\/a> by Grupo Empresarial Bavaria, an international subsidiary of SABMiller.\n\nThe Backus website (¡Aviso! en Español) gives <a href=\"http:\/\/www.backus.com.pe\/WB.WebSite\/cusquena.html\">insight into the beer itself<\/a>. I'll translate for you:\n<blockquote>Cusqueña offers pure and internationally recognized fine flavor that makes us proud of the quality of Peruvian products, to be made with 100% pure barley and Saaz hops, the finest in the world.<\/blockquote>\nTheir UK website gives <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cusquena.co.uk\/home\/\">a little more detail<\/a>, including the fact that they use melt water from 18,000 feet high in the Andes, a marketing tip SABMiller must have learned from their pals at Coors.\n\nFor a bit more on Cusqueña, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anaperuana.com\/2009\/03\/09\/cusquena-and-other-famous-beers-of-peru\/\">this blog post<\/a> I found.

The body is not opaque or cloudy at all, the color is light, and the head is barely off-white, dissipating steadily.\n\nThe aroma is practically non-existent, with the standard bland smell you'd expect from an American light lager. The flavor is somewhat standard for a lager - except the beer is overly sweet, almost to a point of being sickening. I thought that was interesting, considering the beer boasts about using only barley (see above), and not flavorless adjuncts like corn and rice that you'd find in mass-produced American beers.\n\nOverall... I'm glad I tried this, because it's something new, I love to expand horizons, and I got to learn a little bit posting about it - but it's not something that I think I need to have again.","post_title":"Peru Brew: Cusqueña","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"591-revision-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-17 15:24:24","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-17 20:24:24","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"591","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/11\/591-revision-2\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Beyond the name, it's a pretty cool concept beer. Starting with <strong>Jewbelation 8,<\/strong> which had 8 different types of malt and hops, each year they add one more type of malt and one more variety of hops. This is the last year of the series, and they took the seven numbered Jewbelations (8-14), mixed them in a barrel and came out with <strong>Jewbelation Vertical<\/strong>. Now, they're having a special where they're releasing the 8 beers during the 8 days of Chanukah to 88 different bars. Silly puns, mixed with interesting brewing ideas and a high-minded, yet tongue in check concept? Sign me up for that beer!\r\n\r\n<strong>Schmaltz<\/strong> lists the 28 different malts and hops that are in this beer on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shmaltz.com\/HEBREW\/j14.html\">their website<\/a>. It's worth checking out and flipping through the evolution of the Jewbelation series. You can also check out if any local bar is Chosen. Anyway, as today is the beginning of Chanukah, I figured it was as good a time as ever to crack it open write a review.\r\n\r\n<strong>Appearance<\/strong>: Dark, opaque copper with ruby notes when held up to the light. A nice, two finger, tan head that only reluctantly dissipates.

There's something I can't quite place, maybe a holiday spice, but it's certainly intriguing.\r\n\r\n<strong>Taste<\/strong>: The taste starts out with a rich, full caramel malt flavor. It's not cloying, but it's almost overpowering, not quite. After the rich malt, there's a wave of balanced bitterness. It ends with a nice acrid note almost as an after taste. The acridity really helps the flavor from being too rich.  There is a very pleasant, delayed alcohol warmth that hits me in the belly and throat.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mouthfeel<\/strong>: Thick and chewy. It leaves my lips sticky. The head is incredibly creamy, and really adds something to the sip.\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall<\/strong>: This is a really ambitious beer. I think it hits a lot of the notes you want with a big, winter warmer\/strong ale style beer. It has an amazing malt profile with enough hops to balance out and keep it from becoming cloying. The alcohol also works well with this ale, cutting through the richness and serving to warm your whole body.

Turkey Tears is based upon the Sage Against the Machine Pale Ale, but as the flyer says, is brewed with real turkey, cranberries, and honey. Though including meat as an ingredient in beer seems... odd, to say the least, I couldn't resist trying something new.\r\n\r\nThe beer was a light amber color (slightly lighter than it seems from the included picture), with very little head. The aroma was mostly sage with a bit of malt and, yes, a hint of turkey. The flavor itself was mostly sage. There was a slight hint of turkey flavor, but the main thing I got out of the turkey was a really salty taste.

Geoff took in a tasting event at Hopcat in Grand Rapids, and was kind enough to pass along notes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Shorts Huma Lupa Licious<\/strong>\r\nIPA - Pint glass.\r\n\r\nLove the Huma. Always a favorite of mine.  And $6 for a pint plus the house burger and crack fries is a fantastic bargain.  The first taste is of crashing hops bitterness with citrus.  It mellows briefly  before a second wave hits, then the long finish.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hopcat Kodial Killer<\/strong>\r\nAmerican Barleywine - Tulip glass\r\n\r\nDark, near-black appearance with an aroma of whisky and dark fruits.  Drink slowly to keep from being overwhelmed by the alcohol and pronounced fruit notes and ruining the flavor, which is refined by aging for four months in spend Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout barrels.\r\n\r\n<strong>Shorts Bourbon Barrel Huma Lupa Licious <\/strong>\r\nIPA - Globe-shaped sampler glass\r\n\r\nI wanted to be able to directly compare the bourbon barrel version to the standard, and it's almost unnecessary.  The whisky smell is huge off of it, obscuring the grapefruit notes of the original, and the bourbon taste is even bigger, almost obliterating the regular Huma, though it's there underneath everything.  I'll defer to the Hopcat description: \"Think creamy vanilla-laced hop cones, soaked in bourbon.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Shorts Bourbon Barrel Sustenance<\/strong>\r\nSchwartzbier - Tulip\r\n\r\nOh, this is delicious.  Full of the toasty schwartzbier maltiness with the bourbon coming in around the edges.  I could drink this all night\r\n\r\n<strong>Goose Island Bourbon County Stout<\/strong>\r\nGlobe-shaped sampler glass\r\n\r\nI had the Bourbon County Stout before, in a 4-pack of 12-ounce bottles, and it was something of a disappointment.  I'd had the Founders KBS before (on tap at the brewery) and hoped that Goose Island would be able to compete with that.  What I tasted was very good, but not in the same class as the KBS.  I'm extremely happy to report that I was totally off base on that.  On tap, Bourbon County Stout is a revelation.  It's huge, thick; viscous as motor oil and full of chocolate, bourbon, and coffee.  The clear winner on the night.  I still prefer the KBS overall (I think the flavors are a little more complex), but this is ever so close.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dark Horse Plead the 5th<\/strong>\r\nRussian Imperial Stout - Globe-shaped sampler glass\r\n\r\nThe lightest RIS I've ever encountered.  It pours brown and translucent with no real head by the time it was served.  A whiff of alcohol on the nose, not much more in terms of scent, it has a smooth mouthfeel with tastes of dark chocolate and a strong whisky finish.\r\n\r\n<strong>Goose Island Imperial Brown Goose<\/strong>\r\nOld Ale - Globe-shaped sampler glass\r\n\r\nPours dark brown with a persistent, thin off-white head.  Goose Island blended their 2004 and 2005 Christmas ales and aged them in 4-year-old Jim Beam and 12-year-old Heaven Hill bourbon barrels, and I can detect cinnamon and nutmeg among other spices alongside a mellow bourbon flavor.\r\n\r\n<strong>Great Divide Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout<\/strong>\r\nRussian Imperial Stout - Globe-shaped sampler glass\r\n\r\nIt smells like a beer, but tastes STRONGLY of charcoal smoke.  Must be the oak chips it's been aged with, giving it a burnt flavor that lingers for a long time after the vanilla flavors fade away.\r\n\r\n<strong>Avery Samael's Ale<\/strong>\r\nEnglish Barleywine - Globe-shaped sampler glass\r\n\r\nIt tastes sweet and light, but packs a 14.5% ABV wallop and finishes with cinnamon and nutmeg.\r\n\r\n<strong>Founders Backwoods Bastard<\/strong>\r\nWe Heavy Scotch Ale - Globe-shaped sampler glass\r\n\r\nYou can taste the Dirty Bastard under it all, but to me it tastes more like Devil Dancer than anything else.  It has that same way about it where it hits like a sledgehammer and lingers.\r\n\r\n<strong>Founders Black Biscuit<\/strong>\r\nOld Ale - Tulip glass\r\n\r\nThe pour overflowed the glass on the way over and now my hands smell like beer and chocolate.  Black Biscuit has a thin but persistently full head and pours thick and black.  This is a black old ale aged in bourbon barrels, and the chocolate, bourbon, and roasted malt flavors dominate.  It's not quite as huge or complex as a bourbon stout, but the tradeoff is that it's more drinkable.  Definitely give this one a try if you have the chance.\r\n\r\n<strong>Atwater Barrel Aged Cherry Stout Firkin<\/strong>\r\nStout - Globe-shaped sampler glass\r\n\r\nTastes like black cherries soaked in bourbon and dropped into a stout, but not overpowering the stout base.  I'm not a big fan of fruit beers, but I can see myself ordering this as a a full pour.","post_title":"Guest Post: Hopcat Tasting Event","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"617-revision-3","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-11-29 13:07:14","post_modified_gmt":"2010-11-29 18:07:14","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"617","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/11\/617-revision-3\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Though including meat as an ingredient in beer seems... odd, to say the least, I couldn't resist trying something new.\n\nThe beer was a light amber color (slightly lighter than it seems from the included picture), with very little head. The aroma was mostly sage with a bit of malt and, yes, a hint of turkey. The flavor itself was mostly sage. There was a slight hint of turkey flavor, but the main thing I got out of the turkey was a really salty taste. The cranberries didn't seem to add much, and I could barely even detect them in the background. The honey flavor was what you'd expect.\n\nSo, despite my initial hesitance to try a beer with turkey in the brewing process (alas, my server didn't know when in the process it was introduced, though I would guess the boil), it turned out to be not bad.

Some may move on to a limited selection of craft brews, and even some home brews. Few, however, probably move into the realm of trying things that are downright off-the-wall.\r\n\r\nAs I've grown - both in age and as a beer lover - I've become more likely to try something new. Though that doesn't apply just to beer (I was a pretty picky eater as a youngster, now I'll try just about anything at least once), I'm most interested in it from that perspective. There have been plenty of inspirations for the change, at least from a beer perspective:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Homebrew clubs - The <a href=\"http:\/\/aabg.org\">Ann Arbor Brewer's Guild<\/a> was where I first started trying truly new things. Whether it was a creative adjunct or an extreme style, the first few meetings I went to really started expanding my horizons.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/11\/brewery-tour-dogfish-head\/\">Dogfish Head<\/a> - Yes, I know the brewers from Delaware aren't the be-all and end-all of creativity in craft brewing, but that doesn't prevent them from being a huge influence. For example, before watching Brew Masters (flawed though the show may be), I doubt I would have tried a beer that was made from chewed corn.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Other Creative Brewers - I've had a beer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/12\/hopcat-turkey-tears\/\">literally brewed with turkey<\/a>, and one that was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/01\/peppercorn-bacon-beer\/\">designed to be an homage to bacon<\/a>, even if it wasn't brewed with any of the savory stuff.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nI've probably grown to the point where I'd try anything that could be classified as \"beer.\" Whether it's to post about on this site, or just for the experience, I'm all about trying new things.\r\n\r\nThat willingness extends not only to drinking, but to brewing. I probably never would have been willing to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/chili-pepper-beer-recipe\/\">brew a chili pepper beer<\/a>, or have tried to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/10\/recipe-s%e2%80%99more-stout\/\">craft a brew that was s'more flavored<\/a> had it not been for my expanding horizons. Though it's been quite a while since I've brewed (sadly), when I get back into the game, I plan to primarily experiment with off-the-wall ingredients or processes.\r\n\r\nI encourage you to branch out, and be creative (even if it's just in what you choose to drink). There's a lot of good beer out there, and I can't drink it all.","post_title":"Trying Weird Beers","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"trying-weird-beers","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-03-10 12:42:05","post_modified_gmt":"2011-03-10 17:42:05","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=634","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Two of them seemed like pilot episodes—the actual pilot, about Bitches Brew, and the Punkin Chunkin episode—almost to the point of feeling like an incomplete product, but the others have been quite good. My speculation is that the Punkin Chunkin episode was supposed to be the pilot, but they chose to run it for Thanksgiving, and wanted a more interesting episode for the pilot.\r\n\r\nThe general premise of the show is following the creation of a special Dogfish Beer, including everything from the inspiration, to Sam's travels to a foreign land to research authentic brewing methods, all the way to the actual workings of the factory. The two pilot-esque episodes have spent a little too much time focusing on the \"OMG things are going wrong in our factory!\" aspect, dumbing the show down to a standard workplace docu-drama, rather than focusing on the parts that are actually, you know, interesting.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Chicha episode was a step in the right direction, and if the show wants to succeed, it needs to focus on what makes it different than everything else. The inspirations and history of each beer, and Sam's travels to research them, should be by far the focus. If the producers want to focus on the \"characters\" who work at the brewery, that's fine, but \"Oh noes, our machine broke\" and \"crap I spilled glue\" and \"uh oh, quality control error\" warrant barely more than a passing mention. Forced drama = bad, information = good. The workplace stuff just isn't interesting, and if the show fails, that will be its downfall. Even in the most recent episod,e the drama was brewing-related and informative rather than drama for drama's sake.\r\n\r\nAlso on the information end of things, the discussions of the brewing process are interesting, but they're over-referenced (as I mentioned above, I think part of this might be due to airing two \"pilot\" episodes so far), and there either needs to be one small segment per episode where the whole process is discussed. We shouldn't see the hokey CG graphics breaking down the process each time it's discussed.\r\n\r\nAlas, it doesn't seem as though the show is drawing good ratings, as it's already been shuffled around the Discovery Channel's lineup, starting on Sunday nights, then appearing on Monday for one week, and currently moved to Thursday. I think the show is just starting to hit a stride, so canceling it anytime soon would be doing it an injustice.","post_title":"TV Show Review: Brew Masters","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"tv-show-review-brew-masters","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-12-10 12:42:10","post_modified_gmt":"2010-12-10 17:42:10","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=636","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Those living in good beer cities (like my hometown of Ann Arbor, Michigan), probably have the full complement in their very own backyard. I encourage you to continue trying those you haven't been fond of in the past, because there's a good chance you'l miss out on something you like.\r\n\r\nA recent visit from Ann Arbor ex-pat Paul stemmed the standard night for the two of us last weekend: the impromptu microbrewery crawl. Starting with <strong>The Blue Tractor<\/strong>, we moved on to <strong>Arbor Brewing Company<\/strong>, then <strong>Grizzly Peak<\/strong>, and finally <strong>Jolly Pumpkin<\/strong>.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_690\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"493\" caption=\"The route for our impromptu bar crawl\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps\/ms?ie=UTF&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=202378594198924022536.000497efafc0a38182b29\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-690\" title=\"Impromptu Bar Crawl\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/Screen-shot-2010-12-21-at-12.23.49-PM.png\" alt=\"Impromptu Bar Crawl\" width=\"493\" height=\"423\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDespite popular opinions on these fine establishments, I've never been a huge fan of Arbor or Jolly Pumpkin. Believe me, I've tried to find something that I enjoy at each of them, but have found nothing that tickles my fancy. The more knowledgeable folk have raved about them, the more out of the loop I've felt–until now.\r\n\r\nBlue Tractor has never been one of my favorites either, though I've only had drinks there, never food. With my newfound desire to become a barbecue aficionado, that may change soon. Regardless, the offerings on Saturday night did nothing to change my opinion. The atmosphere is just OK, as is the beer. We both had a couple brews that were nothing memorable–aside from the soapy taste of the glassware (yuck!).\r\n\r\nMoving on to Arbor, on the other hand, changed my paradigm. I've found their beers to be merely OK (sometimes trending towards bad), and when combined with a typically rude service staff, I've always been turned off from the place. We found a seat at the bar, however, and I ordered the Fat Abbot Belgian Tripel with Paul selecting the Milestone Cask Porter. To my pleasant surprise, both were not only acceptable, but excellent. The service was iffy as usual, but with a delicious brew in front of you, it's not nearly as offensive.\r\n\r\nWe moved on to Grizzly Peak, typically one of our favorites - we're both mug club members there. An annoying experience with a doorman who thought he was much more important than he truly was colored our experience, setting it up to be something less enjoyable than our standard. The seasonal taps didn't suit our fancy, so we simply ordered menu beers–another strike. As we moved on to the next stop, we felt unsatisfied with a totally mediocre experience.\r\n\r\nWe wrapped up at Jolly Pumpkin's taphouse just down the street. Jolly Pumpkin has an excellent reputation among the beer geeks I've encountered, and although I'm a pretty big fan of Belgian-style beers, I had never been able to find one of their offerings that I was a fan of in my several experiences at the taphouse. Paul and I each ordered beers that were excellent, and not wanting to end the night too intoxicated, split one of their higher-gravity beers before departing. All were enjoyable.\r\n\r\nIf you had told me going into the night that I would have a bad experience at Grizzly Peak, and have multiple excellent beers at Arbor Brewing and Jolly Pumpkin, I would have though you were crazy. Alas, that's the way the night turned out, so I encourage you: If at first you don't enjoy, try try again.","post_title":"If At First You Don't Enjoy...","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"if-at-first-you-dont-enjoy","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-12-21 13:26:51","post_modified_gmt":"2010-12-21 18:26:51","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=686","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

I think part of it is that they have a feeling the ephemerality. Part of it is definitely that they often play to my love of puns. The biggest reason is that their flavor profiles are generally right up my alley. When I think of a winter warmer or holiday beer, I imagine malty, leaning toward sweet, maybe some interesting spice notes, and definitely a warmth from the alcohol. What about that doesn't sound great?\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rogue.com\/\">Rogue<\/a>, living up to its name, rarely plays by the rules. This beer is not exception. It doesn't really fit my stereotype of winter seasonals. In describing it, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rogue.com\/beers\/santas-private-reserve.php\">Rogue says<\/a>:\n<blockquote>Rogue’s annual holiday offering, Santa’s Private Reserve, is a variation of the classic Saint Rogue Red, but with double the hops--including Chinook, and Centennial, and a mystery hop called Rudolph by head brewer John “more hops” Maier!<\/blockquote>\nWhen I think of ways to make something more of a holiday beer, I rarely think, \"Double the hops!\" But, just because it's not falling into my conceptions of what a holiday beer <em>should<\/em> be doesn't mean it can't be a great beer. I tried to approach this tasting as just a beer, not a holiday beer, but I fear my opinion may be colored by what I was hoping for.\n<h3><span style=\"color: #444444;\">Tasting Notes<\/span><\/h3>\nAppearance: Amber with hints of ruby red when held up to the light. It's topped with a 2-finger thick, off-white head  that deliberately came down to about half an inch.\n\nAroma: Caramel and aromatic malts combine for a solid sweetness with some green, earthy hop bitterness.\n\nTaste: A nice, creamy sweetness is quickly backed up by an assertive, balancing hop bitterness. You're left with a lingering, but not coating bitterness.\n\nMouthfeel: Light and bubbly without feeling watery.\n\nOverall: I could go for a bit more malt character and maybe a more piney hop bitterness in a winter seasonal. It's a good, but not remarkable beer.","post_title":"Review: Rouge Santa's Private Reserve","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"643-revision-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-12-13 11:42:12","post_modified_gmt":"2010-12-13 16:42:12","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"643","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/12\/643-revision-2\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Ah, an economically efficient stand-in for homebrew while the brewery is out of commission.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the cider went an uncomfortable amount of time without starting fermentation, which I thought may have been due to the yeast dying after a couple months in the fridge.

On the contrary, it opened new doors for our exploration.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_669\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"The Route\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1633.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-669\" title=\"The Route\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1633-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"The Route\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nI recently strode through one of those doors, taking a road trip from Ann Arbor to Chicago to visit Paul. The travel itself was about 5 hours worth of Interstate 94, but I had other plans. As you can see on the right, I planned to stop at nearly every brewery within a reasonable distance from the highway on my route - with detailed instructions written out (it's always risky to put too much trust in cell phone navigation apps).\r\n\r\nSo, shortly after 11AM on one fine Wednesday, I left town heading West on the highway, hoping to make it to Dark Horse Brewery in Marshall, MI around noon. I got there shortly after my target time, and grabbed a Reserve Special Black Ale. I (quite foolishly) forgot to take any notes on it, or if I did, they're long-lost by this point. It was back the the road.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_671\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Dark Horse Brewing\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1637.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-671\" title=\"Dark Horse Brewing\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1637-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dark Horse Brewing\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFrom Marshall, it was a relatively quick trip to Battle Creek, where I stopped for lunch at Arcadia Brewing Company. Though I'd been there before, it had been a couple years, and much longer since I'd gotten food there. I was surprised then, that a place priding itself on the brewing of authentic Britsh-style ales would also have semi-authentic barbecue comprising a big part of their food menu (along with wood-fired pizzas). I ordered a pulled pork sandwich that came with a choice of several sauces, including chipotle BBQ, Carolina, and Kansas City.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_704\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Arcadia Nut Brown Ale\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_20101201_131731.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-704\" title=\"Arcadia Nut Brown Ale\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_20101201_131731-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Arcadia Nut Brown Ale\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, their beer selection was limited on that day, and I was unable to try something new, having to settle for a brew I'd tried on previous occasions. I went with the Nut Brown (fall seasonal), which was solid as always, but a disappointment because I was looking to expand my horizons.\r\n\r\nAfter taking my time with the meal (and ordering water instead of a second beer, of course), it was back to the road, and I passed up the highway in order to take a back route to Kalamazoo, where I'd stop at Bell's Brewing and the Kalamazoo Beer Exchange - which, while not a brewery, has \"beer\" right in the name, so I couldn't pass it up.\r\n\r\nIn my effort to stay sober, I decided to make Bell's a carry-out only stop, and I popped into their general store for a 6-pack of their Batch 10,000 - the last in their numbered batch series. The store itself was pretty cool as well, with Bell's souvenirs such as T-shirts and hats, along with a cooler stocked with Bell's beers, and even a homebrew section. I regret not walking around the corner to visit the Eccentric Cafe, but I didn't have the time.\r\n\r\nGoing around the corner the other way led to the Kalamazoo Beer Exchange, which had opened just a couple days earlier. Without really knowing what it was (you should really have made it a bit more clear on that <a href=\"http:\/\/kalamazoobeerexchange.com\/\">since-updated website<\/a>, folks) I was pleasantly surprised to find a really cool setup for a multi-story restaurant and bar inside what was otherwise an office building.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_674\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Kalamazoo Beer Exchange Entrance\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1640.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-674\" title=\"Kalamazoo Beer Exchange\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1640-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Kalamazoo Beer Exchange\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_673\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Tommy used to work on the docks...\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1639.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-673\" title=\"Kalamazoo Beer Exchange\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1639-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Kalamazoo Beer Exchange\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;\">Kalamazoo Beer Exchange Interior<\/span>\r\n\r\n<\/dt> <\/dl><\/div>\r\nSince I would be unable to stop into The Livery in Benton Harbor (which didn't open until 4PM), I planned to get my fix of one of their beers at KBE, but some sort of snafu led to ending up with something else - it tasted like a Belgian Dubbel or Tripel - that didn't meet the description of anything that The Livery brews. I had no problem, as it was delicious, but I'll never know which beer I actually ended up drinking there.\r\n\r\nFrom Kalamazoo, it was a long trip before another stop, which I finally made a mere 6 miles from the Indiana border at a tasting room for the Round Barn Winery and Brewery. Not wanting to do any tasting of my own, I was intrigued by their house-made spirits, and since they didn't have a great beer selection available for purchase, I picked up a half-pint of their Whiskey.\r\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"><dl id=\"attachment_677\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px;\"> <dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1643.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-677\" title=\"Shoreline Brewery Setting\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1643-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Shoreline Brewery Setting\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFrom there, it was on the Michigan City, Indiana, where I would eventually end up at a brewery that looked like it was set in a Bon Jovi song. With lakeside factories pumping out exhaust in the background, Shoreline Brewery sits near the banks of Lake Michigan. The building itself seems to be some sort of defunct factory, and it was tricky getting to the taproom area.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_678\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Shoreline Brewery\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1644.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-678\" title=\"Shoreline Brewery\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1644-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Shoreline Brewery\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMy intention was to pick up a growler from Shoreline, but since I didn't know what they had available, I inquired with the kind young lady tending bar what was available. Once she told me they had a barrel-aged series on special, I was hooked. That one of the choices was a barleywine only sealed the deal. I purchased a growler of the beer, and got back on the road.\r\n\r\nAfter an ill-fated stop in Indiana to visit a brewery that had shuttered its windows for good (thanks for mentioning it on your website, guys, or at least disconnecting your phone), I made my way to the final brewery stop of the day: Three Floyds in Munster, Indiana.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_682\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Three Floyds\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1648.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-682\" title=\"Three Floyds\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1648-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Three Floyds\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_683\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Three Floyds\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1649.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-683\" title=\"Three Floyds\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1649-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Three Floyds\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nBy this time, I has grown pretty weary of my travels (and as you can see, night had fallen since the ast time I stepped foot inside a building), so I made quick work of purchasing a 6-pack of Robert the Bruce, a Scotch Ale that I'd never had, despite it being one of the more popular offerings of Three Floyds. With a couple quick pictures of the pub area and one of the brewery, I was ready to finally get on to my destination: Chicago.\r\n\r\nIn all, it was a good time, and though I had planned it well, there were some hiccups along the road. If I were to to it again, I'd certainly try to ensure I wouldn't be flying solo the whole time.","post_title":"ROAD TRIP: Chicago","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"road-trip-chicago","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-01-10 14:18:23","post_modified_gmt":"2011-01-10 19:18:23","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=668","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"2"},

Those living in good beer cities (like my hometown of Ann Arbor, Michigan), probably have the full complement in their very own backyard. I encourage you to continue trying those you haven't been fond of in the pat, because there's a good chance you'l miss out on something you like.\n\nA recent visit from Ann Arbor ex-pat Paul stemmed the standard night for the two of us last weekend: the impromptu microbrewery crawl. Starting with The Blue Tractor, we moved on to Arbor Brewing Company, then Grizzly Peak, and finally Jolly Pumpkin.\n\nDespite popular opinions on these fine establishments, I've never been a huge fan of Arbor or Jolly Pumpkin. Believe me, I've tried to find something that I enjoy at each of them, but have found nothing that tickles my fancy. The more knowledgeable folks that have raved about them, the more out of the loop I've felt - until now.\n\nBlue Tractor has never been one of my favorites either, though I've only had drinks there, never food. With my newfound desire to become a barbecue aficionado, that may change soon. Regardless, the offerings on Saturday night did nothing to change my opinion. The atmosphere is just OK, as is the beer. We both had a couple brews that were nothing memorable - aside from the soapy taste of the glassware (yuck!).\n\nMoving on to Arbor, on the other hand, changed my paradigm. I've found their beers to be merely OK (sometimes trending towards bad), and when combined with a typically rude service staff, I've always been turned off from the place. We found a seat at the bar, however, and I ordered the Fat Abbot Belgian Tripel with Paul selecting the Milestone Cask Porter. To my pleasant surprise, both were not only acceptable, but excellent. The service was iffy as usual, but with a delicious brew in front of you, it's not nearly as offensive.\n\nWe moved on to Grizzly Peak, typically one of our favorites - we're both mug club members there. An annoying experience with a doorman who thought he was much more important than he truly was colored our experience, setting it up to be something less enjoyable than our standard. The seasonal taps didn't suit our fancy, so we simply ordered menu beers - another strike. As we moved on to the next stop, we felt unsatisfied with a totally mediocre experience.\n\nWe wrapped up at Jolly Pumpkin's taphouse just down the street. Jolly Pumpkin has an excellent reputation among the beer geeks I've encountered, and although I'm a pretty big fan of Belgian-style beers, I had never been able to find one of their offerings that I was a fan of in my several experiences at the taphouse. Paul and I each ordered beers that were excellent, and not wanting to end the night too intoxicated, split one of their higher-gravity beers before departing. All were enjoyable.\n\nIf you had told me going into the night that I would have a bad experience at Grizzly Peak, and have multiple excellent beers at Arbor Brewing and Jolly Pumpkin, I would have though you were crazy. Alas, that's the way the night turned out, so I encourage you: If at first you don't enjoy, try try again.","post_title":"If At First You Don't Enjoy...","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"686-revision","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-12-21 13:11:03","post_modified_gmt":"2010-12-21 18:11:03","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"686","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/12\/686-revision\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Jacksonville is a city that seems to be set up to cater to tourists, an odd choice for a city that has no real tourist attractions (outside of an NFL franchise and a bowl game). It's also trying to cultivate a reputation as a brewing city, with the Riverside Brewing District serving as the centerpiece. This district, however, is in the middle of a really bad area of downtown, and doesn't seem to be particularly accessible to tourists, so I strongly recommend against trying to check it out.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_724\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\" caption=\"River City Brewing Company\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2160.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-724  \" title=\"River City Brewing Company\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2160-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"River City Brewing Company\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe place I did manage to check out, however, was River City Brewing Co., on the South side of the St. Johns River in downtown Jacksonville. Part of the building seemed to be a fairly nice restaurant, but there was also a taphouse, where we parked for a quick meal and some beers.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_727\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"384\" caption=\"The Porch View\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2163.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-727 \" title=\"The Porch View\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2163-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"The Porch View\" width=\"384\" height=\"256\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nI'd be remiss not to mention the view from the back porch, which was very nice (I'm a huge sucker for outdoor seating, and an even bigger sucker for outdoor seating on water). Though the main porch area didn't face back toward the heart of downtown J-ville across the river, there were several seating areas outside, and it was a pretty impressive setup overall. Tangent about impressive setups: there was a DJ setting up his equipment out on the back porch for literally the entire time we were there (at least 3 hours, since we watched the entire Rose Bowl). Impressive indeed.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_726\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"384\" caption=\"Beer Menu\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2162.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-726  \" title=\"Beer Menu\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2162-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Beer Menu\" width=\"384\" height=\"256\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAnyway, back to the beer. As you can see in the photo above, the brewery offered four choices brewed in-house (in addition to some macro brews in bottles and on draft). The Mississippi State Alumni Association had their postgame party their (about which fml), and to a man, 100+ people ordered Corona or Miller Lite. Why bother going to a brewpub if that's your plan?\r\n\r\nI tried all four beers, including the JAG, which is what m dad was given when he asked for \"the lightest thing you have.\" The JAG was a standard light ale, with a fully translucent body, and primarily vienna malt.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_725\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Riptide Porter\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2161.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-725\" title=\"Riptide Porter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2161-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Riptide Porter\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMy favorite offering - no surprise - was the Riptide Porter (pictured at right). It was a nice dark brew with good body and a very roasty character. The head dissipated a little quickly, but it was a nice caramel color. Coffee and chocolate were evident, and the roasty character had a nice bitter edge at the end. A very good beer.\r\n\r\nThe third selection was the Jackson Pale Ale. The literature claims it to be a sign of the \"rebirth of hoppy American pale ales\" which doesn't make a ton of sense if you ask me, as Pale Ales and IPAs have been steadily going more toward the hoppy end of the spectrum in this country. The hops were listed as coming from Oregon, but they didn't taste like West Coast hops to me, and they almost had more of a German-type flavor - matching the Vienna malt used.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_728\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Red Rooster Ale\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2164.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-728\" title=\"Red Rooster Ale\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2164-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Red Rooster Ale\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe final selection was the Red Rooster Ale, which is - you guessed it - a Red Ale. This beer (like most of their choices, it seems) was German-inspired, and tasted almost like a Kolsch despite being a true ale. It had a lot of the flavor characteristics you expect from a true German beer, and had good balance throughout. There was nothing spectacular about the beer in any way, but it was a solid selection.\r\n\r\nIn all, I would recommend checking out the River City Brewing Company if ever you find yourself in Jacksonville - though I wouldn't make a special trip just for the brewery.","post_title":"Brewery Review: River City Brewing Company","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"brewery-review-river-city-brewing-company","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-01-24 10:06:39","post_modified_gmt":"2011-01-24 15:06:39","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=707","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Breweries are a business, and the guys (or gals) running them do market research. A not-insignificant chunk of these people (particularly those of the 12-Tribes-of-Israel persuasion) suffer from Celiac's Disease, preventing them from being able to eat (or, more impotantly, drink) glutens.\r\n\r\nThis has spawned a new niche market for gluten-free beer. Buckwheat, sorghum, corn, soy, and many other non-standard grains are used to provide the fermentables in these beers.\r\n\r\nI decided to give one of these beers a try. The one I found was New Planet's Tread Lightly Ale. New Planet is a brewery just opened this year based in Boulder, CO. They are committed to enviromentally conscious beer production. While they currently sell just the Tread Lightly, they aresoon to release two other beers. A portion of each beer style's profits gets donated to a certain non-profit enviromental organization, Tread Lightly's being the Wildlands Restoration Volunteers, a group that does trail maintenance in the Rockies. Hippy, but a cool ideal.\r\n\r\nNew Planet's Tread Lightly Ale - 5.0%\r\n\r\nThis beer pours quite light, with a very modest head  (read: non-existant). The aroma is sweet, almost apple-y. This may come from the large portions of the fermentables coming from corn, or possibly the sorghum (having never brewed with it, I honestly couldn't tell you what it tastes or smells like, feel free to let us know in the comments).

The most number of beers any non-brewery has out here on-tap: Five. Always, 2 of those are New Belgium's Fat Tire (based in Ft. Collins) and Coors Light (Coors is located in Golden, CO, just outside of Denver). Sadly, in the state of more than 80 microbreweries, no one has any other micro on tap.\r\n\r\nAlas, to sate my need for a beer with an actual malt flavor, and having no car here, I purchased a bottle of Samuel Smith's Nut Brown; not reional, I know, but it was the best I could do.\r\n\r\nSamuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale - 5.0% 31 IBU\r\n\r\nThis beer pours with a thick 3 finger head, but it fades fairly quickly. This head releases a nice, earthy, deciduous aroma. This lessens as the head fades leaving a light aroma that compliments the flavor while sipping nicely.\r\n\r\nEven after the large head falls, the beer is a bit more carbonated than I like for this style. I'm not exactly sure if drinking this beer at 9k feet would affect that, but if I had everything in the world my way, I'd like a little less CO2.\r\n\r\nIt tastes as a stereotypical Nut Brown does: a very woody and sweet malt flavor. The dark roasted malts you find in such beers is very prevalent and if you're ever trying to teach someone what various malts roasts contribute to flavors, this would be a great way to isolate darker varieties.\r\n\r\nSuprising me, this beer finished much cleaner than you average nut brown would. I find they tend to linger a bit longer than most beers, but this cleaned up quite quickly. The carbonation may have had something to do with that, but the effect was creating a very drinkable beer. and by the end of my imperial pint, I found myself wanting more.\r\n\r\nThis is a great example of an English Brown ale, more so, I think, than Newcastle BA. I enjoyed it and would love to try a draft of it.","post_title":"Review: Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"695-revision-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2010-12-29 11:48:25","post_modified_gmt":"2010-12-29 16:48:25","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"695","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/12\/695-revision-2\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The aroma was roasted malts with a little bit of hop bitterness.\r\n\r\nThe flavor was almost exactly what you'd come up with if somebody said \"what is the schwarzbier style?\" That is to say, within the style, it was not distinctive at all. The flavor was mostly dark roasted malts, with a little bit of hop bitterness. The body was heavy-ish for a lager, but light among beers overall.\r\n\r\nFor a brewery owned by a corporation whose clear intention is to make a lot of money, not make a lot of great beer, I'm not at all surprised by this offering.

On the contrary, it opened new doors for our exploration.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_669\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"The Route\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1633.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-669\" title=\"The Route\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1633-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"The Route\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nI recently strode through one of those doors, taking a road trip from Ann Arbor to Chicago to visit Paul. The travel itself was about 5 hours worth of Interstate 94, but I had other plans. As you can see on the right, I planned to stop at nearly every brewery within a reasonable distance from the highway on my route - with detailed instructions written out (it's always risky to put too much trust in cell phone navigation apps).\n\nSo, shortly after 11AM on one fine Wednesday, I left town heading West on the highway, hoping to make it to Dark Horse Brewery in Marshall, MI around noon. I got there shortly after my target time, and grabbed a Reserve Special Black Ale. I (quite foolishly) forgot to take any notes on it, or if I did, they're long-lost by this point. It was back the the road.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_671\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Dark Horse Brewing\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1637.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-671\" title=\"Dark Horse Brewing\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1637-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dark Horse Brewing\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nFrom Marshall, it was a relatively quick trip to Battle Creek, where I stopped for lunch at Arcadia Brewing Company. Though I'd been there before, it had been a couple years, and much longer since I'd gotten food there. I was surprised then, that a place priding itself on the brewing of authentic Britsh-style ales would also have semi-authentic barbecue comprising a big part of their food menu (along with wood-fired pizzas). I ordered a pulled pork sandwich that came with a choice of several sauces, including chipotle BBQ, Carolina, and Kansas City.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_704\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Arcadia Nut Brown Ale\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_20101201_131731.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-704\" title=\"Arcadia Nut Brown Ale\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_20101201_131731-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Arcadia Nut Brown Ale\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nUnfortunately, their beer selection was limited on that day, and I was unable to try something new, having to settle for a brew I'd tried on previous occasions. I went with the Nut Brown (fall seasonal), which was solid as always, but a disappointment because I was looking to expand my horizons.\n\nAfter taking my time with the meal (and ordering water instead of a second beer, of course), it was back to the road, and I passed up the highway in order to take a back route to Kalamazoo, where I'd stop at Bell's Brewing and the Kalamazoo Beer Exchange - which, while not a brewery, has \"beer\" right in the name, so I couldn't pass it up.\n\nIn my effort to stay sober, I decided to make Bell's a carry-out only stop, and I popped into their general store for a 6-pack of their Batch 10,000 - the last in their numbered batch series. The store itself was pretty cool as well, with Bell's souvenirs such as T-shirts and hats, along with a cooler stocked with Bell's beers, and even a homebrew section. I regret not walking around the corner to visit the Eccentric Cafe, but I didn't have the time.\n\nGoing around the corner the other way led to the Kalamazoo Beer Exchange, which had opened just a couple days earlier. Without really knowing what it was (you should really have made it a bit more clear on that <a href=\"http:\/\/kalamazoobeerexchange.com\/\">since-updated website<\/a>, folks) I was pleasantly surprised to find a really cool setup for a multi-story restaurant and bar inside what was otherwise an office building.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_674\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Kalamazoo Beer Exchange Entrance\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1640.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-674\" title=\"Kalamazoo Beer Exchange\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1640-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Kalamazoo Beer Exchange\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_673\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Johnny used to work on the docks...\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1639.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-673\" title=\"Kalamazoo Beer Exchange\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1639-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Kalamazoo Beer Exchange\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;\">Kalamazoo Beer Exchange Interior<\/span>\n\n<\/dt> <\/dl><\/div>\nSince I would be unable to stop into The Livery in Benton Harbor (which didn't open until 4PM), I planned to get my fix of one of their beers at KBE, but some sort of snafu led to ending up with something else - it tasted like a Belgian Dubbel or Tripel - that didn't meet the description of anything that The Livery brews. I had no problem, as it was delicious, but I'll never know which beer I actually ended up drinking there.\n\nFrom Kalamazoo, it was a long trip before another stop, which I finally made a mere 6 miles from the Indiana border at a tasting room for the Round Barn Winery and Brewery. Not wanting to do any tasting of my own, I was intrigued by their house-made spirits, and since they didn't have a great beer selection available for purchase, I picked up a half-pint of their Whiskey.\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"><dl id=\"attachment_677\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px;\"><dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1643.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-677\" title=\"Shoreline Brewery Setting\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1643-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Shoreline Brewery Setting\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nFrom there, it was on the Michigan City, Indiana, where I would eventually end up at a brewery that looked like it was set in a Bon Jovi song. With lakeside factories pumping out exhaust in the background, Shoreline Brewery sits near the banks of Lake Michigan.

I hadn't really had many smoked beer before then, but on that day I tried the 440 Pepper Smoker from <a title=\"Original Gravity Brewing\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ogbrewing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Original Gravity<\/a>, and I was hooked. Smoke beers are definitely a weird creation. Malt that has been smoked over hardwood picks up a savory, almost meat-like flavor along with the predictable smokiness.\r\n\r\nI can see them not necessarily being for everyone. They could trend too far from what beer <em>should<\/em> taste like, but personally, I like seeing people push the boundaries of beer and coming up with different and interesting flavors. Also, I drank one of these beers along with a Diavolo sandwich from <a title=\"L'Appetito\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lappetito.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">L'Appetito<\/a>. The mix of the smoked, cured meats, spicy mustard and smokey beer was absolutely amazing.\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_946\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"O&#39;Fallons Smoked Porter\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/IMG_20110110_220656.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-946\" title=\"O'Fallons Smoked Porter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/IMG_20110110_220656-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"O'Fallons Smoked Porter\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAppearance: Dark brown with hints of copper shining through when held up to the light. It poured with a creamy, 2 finger thick tan head that dissipated somewhat quickly and without much lacing.\r\n\r\nAroma: Savory, woody and smoky. It's like a campfire in a good, aromatic way. I've had beers that have crossed the line into cigarette butt, but this stays well away from that.\r\n\r\nTaste: The taste comes in a few waves. It begins with a nice, acrid smokiness, which is quickly followed with roasted, malty sweetness. The aftertaste is a lingering, but not unpleasant acridity.\r\n\r\nMouthfeel: This beer has a medium carbonation. I think it could be just a bit a lower, actually. That might help it feel a bit richer. As it is, it's a bit too thin.\r\n\r\nOverall: I don't know why, but I had been craving a smoked beer. This hits all the spots. I don't regret picking up a six-pack.","post_title":"Review: O'Fallon's Smoke Porter","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"review-ofallons-smoke-porter","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-03-08 10:38:15","post_modified_gmt":"2011-03-08 15:38:15","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=709","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Breweries are a business, and the guys (or gals) running them do market research. A not-insignificant chunk of these people (particularly those of the 12-Tribes-of-Israel persuasion) suffer from Celiac's Disease, preventing them from being able to eat (or, more impotantly, drink) glutens.\r\n\r\nThis has spawned a new niche market for gluten-free beer. Buckwheat, sorghum, corn, soy, and many other non-standard grains are used to provide the fermentables in these beers.\r\n\r\nI decided to give one of these beers a try. The one I found was New Planet's Tread Lightly Ale. New Planet is a brewery just opened this year based in Boulder, CO. They are committed to enviromentally conscious beer production. While they currently sell just the Tread Lightly, they aresoon to release two other beers. A portion of each beer style's profits gets donated to a certain non-profit enviromental organization, Tread Lightly's being the Wildlands Restoration Volunteers, a group that does trail maintenance in the Rockies. Hippy, but a cool ideal.\r\n\r\nNew Planet's Tread Lightly Ale - 5.0%\r\n\r\nThis beer pours quite light, with a very modest head  (read: non-existant). The aroma is sweet, almost apple-y. This may come from the large portions of the fermentables coming from corn, or possibly the sorghum (having never brewed with it, I honestly couldn't tell you what it tastes or smells like, feel free to let us know in the comments). There was little to no hop presence in the aroma, which is fairly true to style.\r\n\r\nThe texture was a suprise to me, being as lightly colored as it was I was expecting something close to an American-style lager, but I was impressed to find it had some weight to it. The hop flavor here is light, its presence is about equal to the orange zest also present. The beer is sugary-sweet, with traces of honey, though, not to the point of being 'sickly-sweet' (a condition I have an issue with, even dry ciders turn my stomach a bit).\r\n\r\nWhile not my favorite style of beer, Tread Lightly certainly raised a few questions for me, particularly about the native African grain sorghum. I'd like to expirement with it as the base for a beer, and possibly various roasted versions of it. Please, if you have any interesting insights into its use, please let us know.","post_title":"Review: New Planet's Tread Lightly Gluten-Free Ale","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"697-revision-3","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-01-07 10:32:34","post_modified_gmt":"2011-01-07 15:32:34","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"697","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/01\/697-revision-3\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

On the contrary, it opened new doors for our exploration.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_669\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"The Route\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1633.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-669\" title=\"The Route\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1633-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"The Route\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nI recently strode through one of those doors, taking a road trip from Ann Arbor to Chicago to visit Paul. The travel itself was about 5 hours worth of Interstate 94, but I had other plans. As you can see on the right, I planned to stop at nearly every brewery within a reasonable distance from the highway on my route - with detailed instructions written out (it's always risky to put too much trust in cell phone navigation apps).\r\n\r\nSo, shortly after 11AM on one fine Wednesday, I left town heading West on the highway, hoping to make it to Dark Horse Brewery in Marshall, MI around noon. I got there shortly after my target time, and grabbed a Reserve Special Black Ale. I (quite foolishly) forgot to take any notes on it, or if I did, they're long-lost by this point. It was back the the road.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_671\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Dark Horse Brewing\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1637.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-671\" title=\"Dark Horse Brewing\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1637-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dark Horse Brewing\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFrom Marshall, it was a relatively quick trip to Battle Creek, where I stopped for lunch at Arcadia Brewing Company. Though I'd been there before, it had been a couple years, and much longer since I'd gotten food there. I was surprised then, that a place priding itself on the brewing of authentic Britsh-style ales would also have semi-authentic barbecue comprising a big part of their food menu (along with wood-fired pizzas). I ordered a pulled pork sandwich that came with a choice of several sauces, including chipotle BBQ, Carolina, and Kansas City.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_704\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Arcadia Nut Brown Ale\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_20101201_131731.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-704\" title=\"Arcadia Nut Brown Ale\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_20101201_131731-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Arcadia Nut Brown Ale\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, their beer selection was limited on that day, and I was unable to try something new, having to settle for a brew I'd tried on previous occasions. I went with the Nut Brown (fall seasonal), which was solid as always, but a disappointment because I was looking to expand my horizons.\r\n\r\nAfter taking my time with the meal (and ordering water instead of a second beer, of course), it was back to the road, and I passed up the highway in order to take a back route to Kalamazoo, where I'd stop at Bell's Brewing and the Kalamazoo Beer Exchange - which, while not a brewery, has \"beer\" right in the name, so I couldn't pass it up.\r\n\r\nIn my effort to stay sober, I decided to make Bell's a carry-out only stop, and I popped into their general store for a 6-pack of their Batch 10,000 - the last in their numbered batch series. The store itself was pretty cool as well, with Bell's souvenirs such as T-shirts and hats, along with a cooler stocked with Bell's beers, and even a homebrew section. I regret not walking around the corner to visit the Eccentric Cafe, but I didn't have the time.\r\n\r\nGoing around the corner the other way led to the Kalamazoo Beer Exchange, which had opened just a couple days earlier. Without really knowing what it was (you should really have made it a bit more clear on that <a href=\"http:\/\/kalamazoobeerexchange.com\/\">since-updated website<\/a>, folks) I was pleasantly surprised to find a really cool setup for a multi-story restaurant and bar inside what was otherwise an office building.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_674\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Kalamazoo Beer Exchange Entrance\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1640.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-674\" title=\"Kalamazoo Beer Exchange\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1640-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Kalamazoo Beer Exchange\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_673\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Johnny used to work on the docks...\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1639.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-673\" title=\"Kalamazoo Beer Exchange\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1639-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Kalamazoo Beer Exchange\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;\">Kalamazoo Beer Exchange Interior<\/span>\r\n\r\n<\/dt> <\/dl><\/div>\r\nSince I would be unable to stop into The Livery in Benton Harbor (which didn't open until 4PM), I planned to get my fix of one of their beers at KBE, but some sort of snafu led to ending up with something else - it tasted like a Belgian Dubbel or Tripel - that didn't meet the description of anything that The Livery brews. I had no problem, as it was delicious, but I'll never know which beer I actually ended up drinking there.\r\n\r\nFrom Kalamazoo, it was a long trip before another stop, which I finally made a mere 6 miles from the Indiana border at a tasting room for the Round Barn Winery and Brewery. Not wanting to do any tasting of my own, I was intrigued by their house-made spirits, and since they didn't have a great beer selection available for purchase, I picked up a half-pint of their Whiskey.\r\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"><dl id=\"attachment_677\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px;\"><dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1643.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-677\" title=\"Shoreline Brewery Setting\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1643-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Shoreline Brewery Setting\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFrom there, it was on the Michigan City, Indiana, where I would eventually end up at a brewery that looked like it was set in a Bon Jovi song.

The travel itself was about 5 hours worth of Interstate 94, but I had other plans. As you can see on the right, I planned to stop at nearly every brewery within a reasonable distance from the highway on my route - with detailed instructions written out (it's always risky to put too much trust in cell phone navigation apps).\n\nSo, shortly after 11AM on one fine Wednesday, I left town heading West on the highway, hoping to make it to Dark Horse Brewery in Marshall, MI around noon. I got there shortly after my target time, and grabbed a Reserve Special Black Ale. I (quite foolishly) forgot to take any notes on it, or if I did, they're long-lost by this point. It was back the the road.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_671\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Dark Horse Brewing\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1637.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-671\" title=\"Dark Horse Brewing\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1637-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Dark Horse Brewing\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nFrom Marshall, it was a relatively quick trip to Battle Creek, where I stopped for lunch at Arcadia Brewing Company. Though I'd been there before, it had been a couple years, and much longer since I'd gotten food there. I was surprised then, that a place priding itself on the brewing of authentic Britsh-style ales would also have semi-authentic barbecue comprising a big part of their food menu (along with wood-fired pizzas).

I went with the Nut Brown (fall seasonal), which was solid as always, but a disappointment because I was looking to expand my horizons.\n\nAfter taking my time with the meal (and ordering water instead of a second beer, of course), it was back to the road, and I passed up the highway in order to take a back route to Kalamazoo, where I'd stop at Bell's Brewing and the Kalamazoo Beer Exchange - which, while not a brewery, has \"beer\" right in the name, so I couldn't pass it up.\n\nIn my effort to stay sober, I decided to make Bell's a carry-out only stop, and I popped into their general store for a 6-pack of their Batch 10,000 - the last in their numbered batch series. The store itself was pretty cool as well, with Bell's souvenirs such as T-shirts and hats, along with a cooler stocked with Bell's beers, and even a homebrew section. I regret not walking around the corner to visit the Eccentric Cafe, but I didn't have the time.\n\nGoing around the corner the other way led to the Kalamazoo Beer Exchange, which had opened just a couple days earlier.

Tangent about impressive setups: there was a DJ setting up his equipment out on the back porch for literally the entire time we were there (at least 3 hours, since we watched the entire Rose Bowl). Impressive indeed.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_726\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"384\" caption=\"Beer Menu\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2162.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-726 \" title=\"Beer Menu\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2162-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Beer Menu\" width=\"384\" height=\"256\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAnyway, back to the beer. As you can see in the photo above, the brewery offered four choices brewed in-house (in addition to some macro brews in bottles and on draft). The Mississippi State Alumni Association had their postgame party their (about which fml), and to a man, 100+ people ordered Corona or Miller Lite. Why bother going to a brewpub if that's your plan?\r\n\r\nI tried all four beers, including the JAG, which is what m dad was given when he asked for \"the lightest thing you have.\" The JAG was a standard light ale, with a fully translucent body, and primarily vienna malt.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_725\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Riptide Porter\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2161.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-725\" title=\"Riptide Porter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2161-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Riptide Porter\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMy favorite offering - no surprise - was the Riptide Porter (pictured at right). It was a nice dark brew with good body and a very roasty character. The head dissipated a little quickly, but it was a nice caramel color. Coffee and chocolate were evident, and the roasty character had a nice bitter edge at the end. A very good beer.\r\n\r\nThe third selection was the Jackson Pale Ale. The literature claims it to be a sign of the \"rebirth of hoppy American pale ales\" which doesn't make a ton of sense if you ask me, as Pale Ales and IPAs have been steadily going more toward the hoppy end of the spectrum in this country. The hops were listed as coming from Oregon, but they didn't taste like West Coast hops to me, and they almost had more of a German-type flavor - matching the Vienna malt used.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_728\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Red Rooster Ale\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2164.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-728\" title=\"Red Rooster Ale\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2164-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Red Rooster Ale\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe final selection was the Red Rooster Ale, which is - you guessed it - a Red Ale. This beer (like most of their choices, it seems) was German-inspired, and tasted almost like a Kolsch despite being a true ale. It had a lot of the flavor characteristics you expect from a true German beer, and had good balance throughout.\r\n\r\nIn all, I would recommend checking out the River City Brewing Company if ever you find yourself in Jacksonville - though I wouldn't make a special trip just for the brewery.","post_title":"Brewery Review: River City Brewing Company","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"707-revision-4","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-01-11 15:13:33","post_modified_gmt":"2011-01-11 20:13:33","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"707","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/01\/707-revision-4\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Jacksonville is a city that seems to be set up to cater to tourists, an odd choice for a city that has no real tourist attractions (outside of an NFL franchise and a bowl game). It's also trying to cultivate a reputation as a brewing city, with the Riverside Brewing District serving as the centerpiece. This district, however, is in the middle of a really bad area of downtown, and doesn't seem to be particularly accessible to tourists, so I strongly recommend against trying to check it out.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_724\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\" caption=\"River City Brewing Company\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2160.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-724  \" title=\"River City Brewing Company\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2160-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"River City Brewing Company\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe place I did manage to check out, however, was River City Brewing Co., on the South side of the St. Johns River in downtown Jacksonville.

Though the main porch area didn't face back toward the heart of downtown J-ville across the river, there were several seating areas outside, and it was a pretty impressive setup overall. Tangent about impressive setups: there was a DJ setting up his equipment out on the back porch for literally the entire time we were there (at least 3 hours, since we watched the entire Rose Bowl). Impressive indeed.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_726\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"384\" caption=\"Beer Menu\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2162.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-726 \" title=\"Beer Menu\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2162-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Beer Menu\" width=\"384\" height=\"256\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAnyway, back to the beer.

I tend to be lazy when I pour, leading to a tall head on my beer, and I had to wait quite a while before I could even finish pouring from the bottle into the glass, because the head did not recede. The beer itself was clear, but a rather dark brown.\r\n\r\nThe aroma is pretty nutty, with both \"brown\" and \"black\" (hazelnut) notes. Yes, I describe flavors by color. I also describe body by terms like \"tastes wet,\" so I guess readers should be used to a... different style from me.\r\n\r\nThe first sip... wow. There's a very strong alcohol flavor on the tongue, but it doesn't linger for long. The taste is deceptively strong, as this is \"only\" a 6.25% beer. There are the standard flavors you expect from a brown, with malt and nutty flavors, though it's maybe a bit drier than you might expect from some browns.\r\n\r\nThe aftertaste is mostly nutty, with some malt. There's bit hop bitterness, but not a whole lot. The important flavors here, clearly, are the malts and nuts.","post_title":"Review: New Holland Cabin Fever","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"review-new-holland-cabin-fever","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-09 08:30:07","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-09 13:30:07","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=751","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The most number of beers any non-brewery has out here on-tap: Five. Always, 2 of those are New Belgium's Fat Tire (based in Ft. Collins) and Coors Light (Coors is located in Golden, CO, just outside of Denver). Sadly, in the state of more than 80 microbreweries, no one has any other micro on tap.\n\nAlas, to sate my need for a beer with an actual malt flavor, and having no car here, I purchased a bottle of Samuel Smith's Nut Brown; not reional, I know, but it was the best I could do.\n\nSamuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale - 5.0% 31 IBU\n\nThis beer pours with a thick 3 finger head, but it fades fairly quickly. This head releases a nice, earthy, deciduous aroma. This lessens as the head fades leaving a light aroma that compliments the flavor while sipping nicely.\n\nEven after the large head falls, the beer is a bit more carbonated than I like for this style. I'm not exactly sure if drinking this beer at 9k feet would affect that, but if I had everything in the world my way, I'd like a little less CO2.\n\nIt tastes as a stereotypical Nut Brown does: a very woody and sweet malt flavor. The dark roasted malts you find in such beers is very prevalent and if you're ever trying to teach someone what various malts roasts contribute to flavors, this would be a great way to isolate darker varieties.\n\nSuprising me, this beer finished much cleaner than you average nut brown would. I find they tend to linger a bit longer than most beers, but this cleaned up quite quickly. The carbonation may have had something to do with that, but the effect was creating a very drinkable beer. and by the end of my imperial pint, I found myself wanting more.\n\nThis is a great example of an English Brown ale, more so, I think, than Newcastle BA. I enjoyed it and would love to try a draft of it.","post_title":"Review: Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"695-revision-5","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-01-09 10:55:52","post_modified_gmt":"2011-01-09 15:55:52","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"695","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/01\/695-revision-5\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Hooray for beer and social networking!\r\n\r\nI won't give a full review of Hopslam, since Tim took care of that, but I wanted mention a few things about the beer and the bar.\r\n<h3>Beer Release Events Are Awesome<\/h3>\r\nTim attended one at Ashley's and my Hopslam release was hosted at Sheffield's. There's something about the feeling of a crowd together, all excited about the same thing. It's the reason I like going to movies at midnight the day they open or going to live sports. There's something about the crowd and shared emotion that makes the event or product itself much more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nBeyond the crowd, I enjoyed having a theme for my drinking. Back in Sheffield's \"Beer School\" bar they had, in addition to Hopslam, Hell Hath No Fury, Winter White and Two Hearted from Bell's. It was like being back in Michigan for a night. When I was there for the tapping of Vrienden, a collaboration between New Belgium and Allagash, they also had a New Belgium Trippel and IPA along with Allagash Black and White. While aimlessly exploring an extensive tap list is fun (and usually the way ago), sometimes a more limited, focused and curated experience is awesome as a change of pace.\r\n<h3>Sheffield's Is Awesome<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_886\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Sheffield&#39;s front bar.

Still, sometimes things just need to be said. The beer list is constantly changing, especially the Beer School Bar. The bar tenders all know and, more importantly, truly enjoy beer.\r\n\r\nThey also have beer focused events fairly often. To kick off my beer-a-palooza weekend,  I'm going to a five course Texas BBQ dinner paired with beers from Founders. They do a fair amount beer tappings and even road trips, including annual pilgrimages to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twobrosbrew.com\/\">Two Brothers<\/a> and to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com\/\">Three Floyds<\/a> for Dark Lord Day. Throw in the awesome barbecue food, you've got my favorite bar in Chicago.\r\n<h3>I Don't Appreciate Bell's As Much As I Should<\/h3>\r\nI lived the first 24 years of my life in Michigan. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bellsbeer.com\/\">Bell's<\/a> has been relevant and even top dog in the craft beer scene since I started thinking, \"maybe there's something better than Bud Light...\" I've never harbored any ill-will toward Bell's, but when I saw it in the stores next to Arcadia, Founders, New Holland or Shorts, I would almost invariably pick one of the smaller guys.\r\n\r\nBeing out in Chicago, it's amazing how excited people get about Bell's releases. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chibeer.org\/\">Chicago Beer Society<\/a> Listserv I subscribed to was flooded with messages about where you could go to get Hopslam on draft or pick up a case or two. This was totally shocking to me. Back in Michigan, an average party store still has a couple six packs of Batch 9000 and Hell Hath No Fury, etc. Here in Chicago, it's a mad dash to grab it before it's gone.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_887\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"A selection of beers made by Bell&#39;s\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/bells.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-887\" title=\"Bell's Beer\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/bells-300x134.jpg\" alt=\"Bell's Beer\" width=\"300\" height=\"134\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMoving away from Michigan has definitely helped me appreciate Bell's more. They have tons of different beers (and an incredibly impressive selection of stouts) and almost all of them are anywhere between Very Good and I Could Die Right Now And Be Happy.\r\n<p style=\"clear: left;\">I'll credit it to a mixture of expatriate nostalgia and appreciation borne from seperation, but now when I see Bell's on draft, I'll snag a pint (especially Two Hearted). I usually have at least on variety of Bell's in the fridge at any given time. In getting excited to try new breweries, I let Bell's fall by the wayside, but that's not fair to them or, more importantly, to me.<\/p>","post_title":"Hopslam in Chicago","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"hopslam-in-chicago","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-21 13:44:57","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-21 18:44:57","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=739","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Some bubbles continue to percolate up throughout the drinking. A 1 finger, creamy head quickly died down, but a thin layer remained.\r\n\r\nAroma: The aroma is dominated with a fruity, berry sweetness with a bit of apple tartness. There's also a hint of hot alcohol in the nose.\r\n\r\nTaste: There's a cloying sweetness and an apple-y, berry flavor. There's a malty sweetness that comes along with the fruit flavor. There's not really any bitterness and very little presence of yeast characteristics like spice or esters. There's a actually a lingering spice and alcohol heat in the aftertaste that helps to balance out the incredible sweetness. Helps.\r\n\r\nMouthfeel: Nice a creamy, but not too chewy. The carbonation level is pretty good. I'm barely down the glass, and I'm already feeling this. I'm not sure what this has to do with the mouthfeel, but there it is.\r\n\r\nOverall: Luckily I drank this as a dessert beer, because it really is overly sweet. I really liked the last Avery bomber I picked up, but this one really misses the mark. It doesn't have what I really love about belgians, the complex flavors and aromas that the yeast gives off. This just has fruity sweetness followed by malty sweetness followed by alcohol. I won't be getting this one again.","post_title":"Review: Avery's The Reverend","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"review-averys-the-reverend","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-01-18 18:34:47","post_modified_gmt":"2011-01-18 23:34:47","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=747","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Between <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/12\/ybd-hard-cider\/\">Tim's stove issue<\/a> and my moving to Chicago, I haven't been able to make any beer since October. That didn't stop us from putting together a mead and a cider, but those really just aren't the same.\r\n\r\nWell, that all changed this Saturday. A friend of mine received a really well put together homebrewing kit for Chistmans\/birthday. The kit was from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.michiganbrewing.com\/\">Michigan Brewing Company's<\/a> homebrew shop called Things Beer and really just had everything, including a propane burner and 7.5gal brew pot. He also received an extract Two Hearted clone recipe kit.\r\n\r\nWe decided that this Friday was going to be the day. We got started around 2 and finished up right about 7. I had never used a propane burner before, and wow, is it a lot nicer than having to wait 90minutes to get the water up to the strike temperature. If we had a wort chiller, we probably could have been done by about 5:45-6pm.\r\n\r\nI've picked up most of the supplies for a 10gal mash tun, and we're going to hopefully have our second brew day next weekend. Given that we have an IPA fermenting, I was thinking either brewing a batch of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2009\/12\/recipe-joe-paterno-is-olde-ale\/\">Joe Paterno is Old Ale<\/a> or the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/oakd-wee-heavy-recipe\/\">Oak'd Wee Heavy<\/a>, both in my top 5 beers I've made.\r\n\r\nIn YB&amp;D form, I made sure this day was documented:\r\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;captions=1&amp;noautoplay=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feat=flashalbum&amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;feed=https%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2Fpanel1382%2Falbumid%2F5562997281056883553%3Falt%3Drss%26kind%3Dphoto%26hl%3Den_US\" \/><param name=\"src\" value=\"https:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/s\/c\/bin\/slideshow.swf\" \/><embed type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/s\/c\/bin\/slideshow.swf\" flashvars=\"host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;captions=1&amp;noautoplay=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feat=flashalbum&amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;feed=https%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2Fpanel1382%2Falbumid%2F5562997281056883553%3Falt%3Drss%26kind%3Dphoto%26hl%3Den_US\"><\/embed><\/object>\r\n\r\n<em>The slideshow seems to not be working at the moment.

I won't be getting this one again.","post_title":"Review: Avery's The Reverend","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"747-revision-4","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-01-18 18:34:46","post_modified_gmt":"2011-01-18 23:34:46","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"747","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/01\/747-revision-4\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

{"ID":"803","post_author":"2","post_date":"2011-01-28 11:05:03","post_date_gmt":"2011-01-28 16:05:03","post_content":"So a couple weeks ago, my friend and I <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/01\/back-in-the-saddle\/\">tried out<\/a> the homebrewing kit that he got for Christmas. It's a fantastic kit with an 8-gallon kettle and a propane burner rig. It is a very nice kit, but it's still a beginner-ish kit that is definitely geared toward extract brewing. There's nothing wrong with extract brewing, but I've done all-grain. I like all-grain, and - as a control freak - I like to be able to see all the raw materials, etc. Also, my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2009\/12\/recipe-joe-paterno-is-olde-ale\/\">favorite<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/oakd-wee-heavy-recipe\/\">beer recipes<\/a> are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/chili-pepper-beer-recipe\/\">all-grain<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThere are some really snazzy mash tuns available, but they are all out of my price range. That left one option: do it yourself.  Fortunately, I really like this option. I make no claims that I was around in the early days of homebrewing, but I imagine there was a lot of re-imagining and creative repurposing of existing materials because homebrewing supplies just didn't exist. There's something entrepreneurial, pioneering and empowering about making a mash tun out of items you can find at your local hardware store of choice.\r\n\r\nWe made a mash tun before, using a 5gal cooler and plastic false bottom that we got from Tim's uncle. We poked around online and put together a system that barely even leaks and rarely sticks. There's room for improvement, but it works.\r\n\r\nFor my second go-round, I decided to go bigger. Between having a bit more of a budget, an 8-gallon kettle (vs. 5 in Ann Arbor) and a bit more comfortable bank account, I <em>had<\/em> to go for a 10-gallon cooler, right? I looked up prices online, and the best I found (taking into account shipping costs) was this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/h_d1\/N-5yc1v\/R-202260809\/h_d2\/ProductDisplay?storeId=10051&amp;keyword=10+gallon+rubbermaid+cooler&amp;jspStoreDir=hdus&amp;Nu=P_PARENT_ID&amp;navFlow=3&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;ddkey=Search\">10gallon Rubbermaid cooler at the Home Depot for $39.96<\/a>. Next step was finding a construction guide.\r\n\r\nI mentioned <a href=\"http:\/\/www.HomeBrewTalk.com \">HomeBrewTalk.com <\/a>in my post about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/11\/beer-tools-on-the-web\/\">beer tools on the Web<\/a>, and beyond their forums (which are excellent) they maintain the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewtalk.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Main_Page\">Home Brewing Wiki<\/a> which has a ton of great information on different ingredients, methods AND step by step instructions on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewtalk.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Converting_a_cooler_to_a_mash_tun#How_to_make_a_cheap_10_or_5_gallon_MLT_with_a_Rubbermaid_Cooler.\">converting a cooler to a mash-tun<\/a>!\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"180\" caption=\"Mash Tun Parts\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewtalk.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Converting_a_cooler_to_a_mash_tun#How_to_make_a_cheap_10_or_5_gallon_MLT_with_a_Rubbermaid_Cooler.\"><img title=\"Mash Tun Parts\" src=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewtalk.com\/wiki\/images\/thumb\/5\/53\/1_All_Parts_r-1-.jpg\/180px-1_All_Parts_r-1-.jpg\" alt=\"Mash Tun Parts\" width=\"180\" height=\"241\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis awesome guide has pictures, part numbers and pretty much every question you might have. Armed with this info, I went to the hardware store and bought everything I needed. All told, it was right around $65. Yeah. $40 for the cooler and $25 for everything else to turn it into an awesome piece of homebrewing equipment.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part of the whole process was removing the plastic tubing from the steel weave. It took two of us. My friend was holding on to the tubing with needle nose pliers and I had the vice grips attached to the weave. If we would have read the instructions closely (who does that?) we would have just pushed it off with no problem.\r\n\r\nWe put it all together and threw a couple gallons of water into it and there were no leaks. SUCCESS! The next test was to see how the steel weave handled the mash and sparge.\r\n\r\nI have to say, I was very impressed. The Old Ale recipe we were brewing uses all husked grains, so there was a good bed, but still, it flowed incredibly smoothly and quickly. Probably better than the plastic false bottom in the other mash tun. Part of it may be we were able to add more water which allows for more pressure, but man did it ever work well.\r\n\r\nThe crazy thing was how easy it was. We put this thing together in the time it took our mashing water to get up to strike temperature. The only tools we used were a hacksaw, needle nose pliers and some vice grips. If you can find an inexpensive cooler, the hardware seriously costs $25 or so, and you could probably save $25 within your first dozen batches of brewing all-grain versus extract.\r\n\r\nIf you're thinking about taking that next step and going all-grain, you no longer have an excuse. I've built a mash tun from scratch, and that means you can too.","post_title":"I Love It When a Plan Comes Together","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"i-love-it-when-a-plan-comes-together","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-01-28 11:05:03","post_modified_gmt":"2011-01-28 16:05:03","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=803","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

In all, this was a very good beer, and despite the audacious selection of ingredients, was subtle and well-balanced.\r\n\r\n<em>* On a related note, they're <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arborbrewing.com\/index.php?site=cornerbrewery&amp;page=menu3&amp;submenu=1\">having a Rat Fest tomorrow<\/a>, with several homebrews available.

Jacksonville is a city that seems to be set up to cater to tourists, an odd choice for a city that has no real tourist attractions (outside of an NFL franchise and a bowl game). It's also trying to cultivate a reputation as a brewing city, with the Riverside Brewing District serving as the centerpiece. This district, however, is in the middle of a really bad area of downtown, and doesn't seem to be particularly accessible to tourists, so I strongly recommend against trying to check it out.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_724\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\" caption=\"River City Brewing Company\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2160.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-724  \" title=\"River City Brewing Company\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2160-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"River City Brewing Company\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe place I did manage to check out, however, was River City Brewing Co., on the South side of the St. Johns River in downtown Jacksonville. Part of the building seemed to be a fairly nice restaurant, but there was also a taphouse, where we parked for a quick meal and some beers.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_727\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"384\" caption=\"The Porch View\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2163.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-727 \" title=\"The Porch View\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2163-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"The Porch View\" width=\"384\" height=\"256\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nI'd be remiss not to mention the view from the back porch, which was very nice (I'm a huge sucker for outdoor seating, and an even bigger sucker for outdoor seating on water). Though the main porch area didn't face back toward the heart of downtown J-ville across the river, there were several seating areas outside, and it was a pretty impressive setup overall. Tangent about impressive setups: there was a DJ setting up his equipment out on the back porch for literally the entire time we were there (at least 3 hours, since we watched the entire Rose Bowl). Impressive indeed.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_726\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"384\" caption=\"Beer Menu\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2162.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-726 \" title=\"Beer Menu\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2162-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Beer Menu\" width=\"384\" height=\"256\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAnyway, back to the beer. As you can see in the photo above, the brewery offered four choices brewed in-house (in addition to some macro brews in bottles and on draft). The Mississippi State Alumni Association had their postgame party their (about which fml), and to a man, 100+ people ordered Corona or Miller Lite. Why bother going to a brewpub if that's your plan?\r\n\r\nI tried all four beers, including the JAG, which is what m dad was given when he asked for \"the lightest thing you have.\" The JAG was a standard light ale, with a fully translucent body, and primarily vienna malt.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_725\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Riptide Porter\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2161.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-725\" title=\"Riptide Porter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2161-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Riptide Porter\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMy favorite offering - no surprise - was the Riptide Porter (pictured at right). It was a nice dark brew with good body and a very roasty character. The head dissipated a little quickly, but it was a nice caramel color. Coffee and chocolate were evident, and the roasty character had a nice bitter edge at the end. A very good beer.\r\n\r\nThe third selection was the Jackson Pale Ale. The literature claims it to be a sign of the \"rebirth of hoppy American pale ales\" which doesn't make a ton of sense if you ask me, as Pale Ales and IPAs have been steadily going more toward the hoppy end of the spectrum in this country. The hops were listed as coming from Oregon, but they didn't taste like West Coast hops to me, and they almost had more of a German-type flavor - matching the Vienna malt used.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_728\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Red Rooster Ale\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2164.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-728\" title=\"Red Rooster Ale\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2164-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Red Rooster Ale\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe final selection was the Red Rooster Ale, which is - you guessed it - a Red Ale. This beer (like most of their choices, it seems) was German-inspired, and tasted almost like a Kolsch despite being a true ale. It had a lot of the flavor characteristics you expect from a true German beer, and had good balance throughout. There was nothing spectacular about the beer in any way, but it was a solid selection.\r\n\r\nIn all, I would recommend checking out the River City Brewing Company if ever you find yourself in Jacksonville - though I wouldn't make a special trip just for the brewery.","post_title":"Brewery Review: River City Brewing Company","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"707-revision-7","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-01-11 15:14:12","post_modified_gmt":"2011-01-11 20:14:12","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"707","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/01\/707-revision-7\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The beer itself was clear, but a rather dark brown.\n\nThe aroma is pretty nutty, with both \"brown\" and \"black\" (hazelnut) notes. Yes, I describe flavors by color. I also describe body by terms like \"tastes wet,\" so I guess readers should be used to a... different style from me.\n\nThe first sip... wow. There's a very strong alcohol flavor on the tongue, but it doesn't linger for long. The taste is deceptively strong, as this is \"only\" a 6.25% beer.

That reignited my interest in sour ales, so when I saw this Oud Bruin, I had to pick it up.\r\n\r\nSour ales seem to be one of the final bridges craft beer folk cross. There's something very different about the tart, lactic taste that sort of goes against the flavors I typically associate with beer. It may be that exact reason why I like them so much. They're so very different from the rank and file beers and, to an extent, even the crazier craft brews.\r\n\r\nThis particular beer is brewed in Belgium for Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia, PA. It is a mix of old, aged beer and young. My tasting notes are below the picture.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_775\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Monk&#39;s Cafe Flemish Sour Ale - 5.5% ABV\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_20110121_205512.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-775\" title=\"Monk's Cafe Flemish Sour Ale\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_20110121_205512-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Monk's Cafe Flemish Sour Ale\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAppearance: It pours a cloudy, brownish red with a thick, tan head that receded quickly with a bit of lacing. The last half inch of the head is holding strong. I can see the CO2 bubbling up from the bottom.\r\n\r\nAroma: The aroma is almost all that lactic sourness. There may be a light fruitiness, but nothing comes through clearly over the sourness.\r\n\r\nTaste: The taste is nowhere near as overwhelming sour as the nose. In fact, I might almost want a bit more sourness. My first sip had a lot of fruity, caramel-malt sweetness, tempered with a note of sourness and finishing witha  smooth sweetness. The more I drink it, the less cloying it seems, and the balance comes through. No hop character to speak of, but that really wouldn't be necessary. There's the smallest hint of funkiness, but it comes and goes. Very complicated and tasty.\r\n\r\nMouthfeel: Very smooth and just shy of creamy. It's lightly carbonated, but still with a nice, light effervescence.\r\n\r\nOverall: I really like this beer. I've been into sours of late, and this hits the notes without being overwhelming. The sweet and tart notes play well together and produce a really tasty, well crafted beer.","post_title":"Review: Monks's Cafe Flemish Sour Red Ale","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"review-monkss-cafe-flemish-sour-red-ale","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-01-25 15:13:05","post_modified_gmt":"2011-01-25 20:13:05","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=774","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The last half inch of the head is holding strong. I can see the CO2 bubbling up from the bottom.\n\nAroma: The aroma is almost all that lactic sourness. There may be a light fruitiness, but nothing comes through clearly over the sourness.\n\nTaste: The taste is nowhere near as overwhelming sour as the nose. In fact, I might almost want a bit more sourness. My first sip had a lot of fruity, caramel-malt sweetness, tempered with a note of sourness and finishing witha  smooth sweetness. The more I drink it, the less cloying it seems, and the balance comes through. No hop character to speak of, but that really wouldn't be necessary. There's the smallest hint of funkiness, but it comes and goes. Very complicated and tasty.\n\nMouthfeel: Very smooth and just shy of creamy. It's lightly carbonated, but still with a nice, light effervescence.\n\nOverall: I really like this beer. I've been into sours of late, and this hits the notes without being overwhelming. The sweet and tart notes play well together and produce a really tasty, well crafted beer.","post_title":"Review: Monks's Cafe Flemish Sour Red Ale","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"774-revision","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-01-21 22:10:22","post_modified_gmt":"2011-01-22 03:10:22","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"774","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/01\/774-revision\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Both come via <a href=\"http:\/\/ilovecharts.tumblr.com\">I Love Charts<\/a>. The first one has made the rounds across the beer blogosphere in the past week or so:\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_812\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"286\" caption=\"The United States of Beer (click for big)\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/usabeer.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-812\" title=\"The United States of Beer\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/usabeer-286x300.jpg\" alt=\"The United States of Beer Map\" width=\"286\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.houstonpress.com\/eating\/2011\/01\/the_united_states_of_beer.php\">methodology behind some of the choices<\/a> is... questionable - often boiling down to \"Hey, we can't think of anything better... BUSCH LIGHT!!!\" - but at least the three states represented by the writers of this here blog (Bell's for me, Goose Island for Paul, and New Belgium for The Prodigal Son). Of course, as a Grand Rapids ex-pat, I'd cast my vote for Founder's as Michigan's representative beer - and RateBeer seems to agree, rating it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ratebeer.com\/RateBeerBest\/bestbrewers_012011.asp\">the second-best brewer in the whole world<\/a> - but I'm glad to see the obvious choice of Coor's doesn't get forced on Nate out in the Rocky Mountain State. Anything you'd like to see changed?\r\n\r\nThe second chart also comes via <a href=\"http:\/\/ilovecharts.tumblr.com\/post\/3037723633\">I Love Charts<\/a>, and is a graphical breakdown of different beer styles, and how they relate to each other:\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_813\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Beer Style Family Tree (click for big)\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/beertree.gif\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-813\" title=\"Beer Style Family Tree\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/beertree-300x255.gif\" alt=\"Beer Style Family Tree\" width=\"300\" height=\"255\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAgain, I don't think the chart is perfect. There are a lot of style types missing - but maybe that's a sign we're getting too specific naming styles, no? Still, it's an interesting chart, and though there are omissions, and possibly some incorrect relationships, it speaks to the visual learner in me.\r\n\r\nIf all those styles make it a bit difficult, the folks at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sloshspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">sloshspot.com<\/a> have put together a handy flow chart.

Jacksonville is a city that seems to be set up to cater to tourists, an odd choice for a city that has no real tourist attractions (outside of an NFL franchise and a bowl game). It's also trying to cultivate a reputation as a brewing city, with the Riverside Brewing District serving as the centerpiece. This district, however, is in the middle of a really bad area of downtown, and doesn't seem to be particularly accessible to tourists, so I strongly recommend against trying to check it out.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_724\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\" caption=\"River City Brewing Company\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2160.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-724  \" title=\"River City Brewing Company\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2160-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"River City Brewing Company\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe place I did manage to check out, however, was River City Brewing Co., on the South side of the St. Johns River in downtown Jacksonville. Part of the building seemed to be a fairly nice restaurant, but there was also a taphouse, where we parked for a quick meal and some beers.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_727\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"384\" caption=\"The Porch View\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2163.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-727 \" title=\"The Porch View\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2163-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"The Porch View\" width=\"384\" height=\"256\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nI'd be remiss not to mention the view from the back porch, which was very nice (I'm a huge sucker for outdoor seating, and an even bigger sucker for outdoor seating on water). Though the main porch area didn't face back toward the heart of downtown J-ville across the river, there were several seating areas outside, and it was a pretty impressive setup overall. Tangent about impressive setups: there was a DJ setting up his equipment out on the back porch for literally the entire time we were there (at least 3 hours, since we watched the entire Rose Bowl). Impressive indeed.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_726\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"384\" caption=\"Beer Menu\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2162.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-726 \" title=\"Beer Menu\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2162-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Beer Menu\" width=\"384\" height=\"256\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAnyway, back to the beer. As you can see in the photo above, the brewery offered four choices brewed in-house (in addition to some macro brews in bottles and on draft). The Mississippi State Alumni Association had their postgame party their (about which fml), and to a man, 100+ people ordered Corona or Miller Lite. Why bother going to a brewpub if that's your plan?\r\n\r\nI tried all four beers, including the JAG, which is what m dad was given when he asked for \"the lightest thing you have.\" The JAG was a standard light ale, with a fully translucent body, and primarily vienna malt.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_725\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Riptide Porter\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2161.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-725\" title=\"Riptide Porter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2161-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Riptide Porter\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMy favorite offering - no surprise - was the Riptide Porter (pictured at right). It was a nice dark brew with good body and a very roasty character. The head dissipated a little quickly, but it was a nice caramel color.

Jacksonville is a city that seems to be set up to cater to tourists, an odd choice for a city that has no real tourist attractions (outside of an NFL franchise and a bowl game). It's also trying to cultivate a reputation as a brewing city, with the Riverside Brewing District serving as the centerpiece. This district, however, is in the middle of a really bad area of downtown, and doesn't seem to be particularly accessible to tourists, so I strongly recommend against trying to check it out.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_724\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\" caption=\"River City Brewing Company\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2160.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-724  \" title=\"River City Brewing Company\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2160-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"River City Brewing Company\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe place I did manage to check out, however, was River City Brewing Co., on the South side of the St. Johns River in downtown Jacksonville. Part of the building seemed to be a fairly nice restaurant, but there was also a taphouse, where we parked for a quick meal and some beers.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_727\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"384\" caption=\"The Porch View\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2163.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-727 \" title=\"The Porch View\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2163-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"The Porch View\" width=\"384\" height=\"256\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nI'd be remiss not to mention the view from the back porch, which was very nice (I'm a huge sucker for outdoor seating, and an even bigger sucker for outdoor seating on water). Though the main porch area didn't face back toward the heart of downtown J-ville across the river, there were several seating areas outside, and it was a pretty impressive setup overall. Tangent about impressive setups: there was a DJ setting up his equipment out on the back porch for literally the entire time we were there (at least 3 hours, since we watched the entire Rose Bowl). Impressive indeed.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_726\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"384\" caption=\"Beer Menu\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2162.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-726 \" title=\"Beer Menu\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2162-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Beer Menu\" width=\"384\" height=\"256\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAnyway, back to the beer. As you can see in the photo above, the brewery offered four choices brewed in-house (in addition to some macro brews in bottles and on draft). The Mississippi State Alumni Association had their postgame party their (about which fml), and to a man, 100+ people ordered Corona or Miller Lite. Why bother going to a brewpub if that's your plan?\r\n\r\nI tried all four beers, including the JAG, which is what m dad was given when he asked for \"the lightest thing you have.\" The JAG was a standard light ale, with a fully translucent body, and primarily vienna malt.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_725\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Riptide Porter\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2161.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-725\" title=\"Riptide Porter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2161-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Riptide Porter\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMy favorite offering - no surprise - was the Riptide Porter (pictured at right). It was a nice dark brew with good body and a very roasty character. The head dissipated a little quickly, but it was a nice caramel color. Coffee and chocolate were evident, and the roasty character had a nice bitter edge at the end. A very good beer.\r\n\r\nThe third selection was the Jackson Pale Ale.

There's a very strong alcohol flavor on the tongue, but it doesn't linger for long. The taste is deceptively strong, as this is \"only\" a 6.25% beer. There are the standard flavors you expect from a brown, with malt and nutty flavors, though it's maybe a bit drier than you might expect from some browns.\n\nThe aftertaste is mostly nutty, with a bit of malt.

Either way, no complaints here.\r\n\r\nThe aroma had plenty of malt, and just barely a hint of raisins - which, to be fair, don't exactly have a strong aroma themselves. The flavor was a nice deep maltiness, but again, I hardly even got a hint of the raisin flavor. If you're going to make a beer somehow \"special\" or distinct by including an adjunct, that should be present. I'm not asking for it to be overwhelming, just existent.\r\n\r\nLack of raisin flavor notwithstanding, this was an all-around mediocre beer. The malt flavors were present, but not as strong as you'd expect from a barleywine. It almost tasted a bit watered down, or more like a brown ale. Adding to that, when I was drinking it, I didn't think it tasted particularly strong, but I quickly realized that probably wasn't the case, as I got a buzz going before I was done with it. The flavor was weaker than the actual alcohol (11.0%) and malt content, which I don't regard as a positive asset.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would drink this beer again, but certainly wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it.","post_title":"Review: Short's The Wizard","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"review-shorts-the-wizard","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-24 12:48:38","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-24 17:48:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=786","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

That reignited my interest in sour ales, so when I saw this Oud Bruin, I had to pick it up.\n\nSour ales seem to be one of the final bridges craft beer folk cross. There's something very different about the tart, lactic taste that sort of goes against the flavors I typically associate with beer. It may be that exact reason why I like them so much. They're so very different from the rank and file beers and, to an extent, even the crazier craft brews.\n\nThis particular beer is brewed in Belgium for Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia, PA. It is a mix of old, aged\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_775\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Monk&#39;s Cafe Flemish Sour Ale - 5.5% ABV\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_20110121_205512.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-775\" title=\"Monk's Cafe Flemish Sour Ale\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_20110121_205512-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Monk's Cafe Flemish Sour Ale\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nAppearance: It pours a cloudy, brownish red with a thick, tan head that receded quickly with a bit of lacing. The last half inch of the head is holding strong. I can see the CO2 bubbling up from the bottom.\n\nAroma: The aroma is almost all that lactic sourness. There may be a light fruitiness, but nothing comes through clearly over the sourness.\n\nTaste: The taste is nowhere near as overwhelming sour as the nose. In fact, I might almost want a bit more sourness. My first sip had a lot of fruity, caramel-malt sweetness, tempered with a note of sourness and finishing witha  smooth sweetness. The more I drink it, the less cloying it seems, and the balance comes through. No hop character to speak of, but that really wouldn't be necessary. There's the smallest hint of funkiness, but it comes and goes. Very complicated and tasty.\n\nMouthfeel: Very smooth and just shy of creamy. It's lightly carbonated, but still with a nice, light effervescence.\n\nOverall: I really like this beer. I've been into sours of late, and this hits the notes without being overwhelming. The sweet and tart notes play well together and produce a really tasty, well crafted beer.","post_title":"Review: Monks's Cafe Flemish Sour Red Ale","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"774-revision-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-01-25 15:12:33","post_modified_gmt":"2011-01-25 20:12:33","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"774","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/01\/774-revision-2\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

It's a fantastic kit with an 8gallon kettle and a propane burner rig. It is a very nice kit, but it's still a beginner-ish kit that is definitely geared toward extract brewing. There's nothing wrong with extract brewing, but I've done all-grain. I like all-grain, and, being a control freak, I like to be able to see all the raw materials, etc. Also, my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2009\/12\/recipe-joe-paterno-is-olde-ale\/\">favorite<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/oakd-wee-heavy-recipe\/\"> recipes<\/a> are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/chili-pepper-beer-recipe\/\">all-grain<\/a>.\n\nThere became only one option: make a mash-tun. There are some really snazzy options out there, but they are all out of my price range. That left one option: do it yourself.  I really like this option. Not that I was around in the early days of homebrewing, but I imagine there was  a lot of re-imagining and repurposing of existing materials because homebrewing supplies just didn't exist. There's something incredibly entrepreneurial, pioneering and empowering about making a mash-tun out of items you can find at the Home Depot or your hardware store of choice.\n\nWe made a mash tun before, using a 5gal cooler and plastic false bottom that we got from Tim's uncle. We poked around online and put together a system that barely even leaks and rarely sticks. It could probably be better, but it works.\n\nFor my second go-round, I decided to go bigger. Between having a bit more of a budget, an 8gallon kettle (vs. 5 in Ann Arbor) and a bit more comfortable bank account, I <em>had<\/em> to go for a 10gallon cooler, right? I looked up prices online, and the best I found (taking into account shipping costs) was this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/h_d1\/N-5yc1v\/R-202260809\/h_d2\/ProductDisplay?storeId=10051&amp;keyword=10+gallon+rubbermaid+cooler&amp;jspStoreDir=hdus&amp;Nu=P_PARENT_ID&amp;navFlow=3&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;ddkey=Search\">10gallon Rubbermaid cooler at the Home Depot for $39.96<\/a>. Next step was finding a construction guide.\n\nI mentioned <a href=\"http:\/\/www.HomeBrewTalk.com \">HomeBrewTalk.com <\/a>in my post about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/11\/beer-tools-on-the-web\/\">beer tools on the Web<\/a>, and beyond their forums (which are excellent) they maintain the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewtalk.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Main_Page\">Home Brewing Wiki<\/a> which has a ton of great information on different ingredients, methods AND step by step instructions on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewtalk.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Converting_a_cooler_to_a_mash_tun#How_to_make_a_cheap_10_or_5_gallon_MLT_with_a_Rubbermaid_Cooler.\">converting a cooler to a mash-tun<\/a>!\n\nThis awesome guide has pictures, part numbers and pretty much every question you might have.

Collarbone. Sadface).\r\n\r\nThis year, one of my favorite stories came out before the Big Game itself. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States... <em>Homebrewer? <\/em>From Obama Foodorama - which is apparently a blog all about food news from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - comes the news that The Leader of the Free World and his wife <a href=\"http:\/\/obamafoodorama.blogspot.com\/2011\/02\/president-first-lady-host-white-house.html\">have taken up the hobby<\/a>:\r\n<blockquote>President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama have joined the home brewing beer trend that's swept the US, and will be serving a very special White House brew tonight when they welcome guests for the annual Super Bowl party, to watch as the Packers take on the Steelers.<\/blockquote>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_833\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"196\" caption=\"White House Honey Ale\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/whitehousebeer.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-833\" title=\"White House Honey Ale\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/whitehousebeer-196x300.jpg\" alt=\"White House Honey Ale: Obama Beer\" width=\"196\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\n...But not so fast my friends. Lest you worry that President Obama is more concerned with Alpha Acids and Original Gravities than Egypt and Healthcare, he's not crafting the Ales himself:\r\n<blockquote>In a special turn of events in the history of White House food creations, one of the White House chefs has brewed White House Honey Ale, a White House aide exclusively tipped ObFo... The President, First Lady, and their guests will be sampling the special suds for the first time this evening. And the Obamas paid for the micro-brewing equipment, the aide noted, so there's no impact on the national debt.<\/blockquote>\r\nI never thought the \"home\" in \"homebrewing\" would mean one of the world's most famous residences, even if the POTUS himself is not the brewer. I wonder if it's a little too early to get some reviews of the beer from Obama's guests.\r\n\r\nHomebrewing Guru Charlie Papazian chimes in on the news, saying George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were known to brew, but <a href=\"http:\/\/www.examiner.com\/beer-in-national\/white-house-serves-up-own-homebrewed-white-house-honey-ale\">probably never in the White House<\/a>.\r\n\r\nHmm... sounds like a topic for future research.","post_title":"Obama, Brewer?","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"obama-brewer","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-07 10:46:46","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-07 15:46:46","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=828","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

It was included as part of a beginner's brewing kit by a local store - and it definitely is not a beginner's brewing book.\n\nThat's not to say it's difficult to read, or even to understand, but it isn't organized as a step-by-step process to completing your first brew, and then advancing from there. Though Papzian hits basics at various points in the book, a general understanding of how to brew a batch of beer is probably required unless you want to read the whole book multiple times before you can even get started. Each section covers a different aspect of the brewing process, and does so from the basics to some of the more advanced homebrewing techniques within that category.\n\nStill, some of the organization issues persist even when the reader has a better understanding of the brewing process. Tangents abound, and sometimes there's an abrupt change of subject that even this now-experienced (this was the first brewing book I read, but that was over a year and 20-some batches ago) finds tedious, or even scatterbrained. And scatterbrained might be an important part of the Cult of Personality that Papazian has built his homebrewing reputation upon. Still, too often \"I could continue explaining this to you, but wouldn't you rather be drinking?\" is dropped, when the reader is obviously interested in finding out the details - hence picking up a brewing book, dude.\n\nThe final hundred pages or so contain recipes for various brews that Papazian has crafted over the years, often with creative nicknames (\"dfhdgh\" is one of my favorites). Those recipes are reference points more than anything for advanced brewers, though, continuing with the theme of Papazian not picking out an audience (experienced or beginner) and sticking to it. There are very few all-grain recipes, a source of frustration for those who are branching out a bit.\n\nAt the end of the day, this book is a fun read, a relatively easy read, but certainly not an essential one. Don't pick it up if you're trying to learn how to brew for the first time - go with one of Papazian's other offerings. Don't pick it up if you're trying to take your brewing to serious new levels (though his breakdown of various all-grain mashing techniques is very good), either. However, as part of a more complete brewing library, or just as a fun read about homebrewing, it's worthwhile.\n\nIf you're interested in purchasing, do so through this Amazon affiliate link: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0060584734?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=yeasanddown-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060584734\">The Homebrewer's Companion<\/a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=yeasanddown-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0060584734\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" \/>","post_title":" Book Review: The Homebrewer's Companion","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"109-revision-8","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-01-21 17:24:30","post_modified_gmt":"2011-01-21 22:24:30","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"109","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/01\/109-revision-8\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Tangents abound, and sometimes there's an abrupt change of subject that even this now-experienced (this was the first brewing book I read, but that was over a year and 20-some batches ago) finds tedious, or even scatterbrained. And scatterbrained might be an important part of the Cult of Personality that Papazian has built his homebrewing reputation upon. Still, too often \"I could continue explaining this to you, but wouldn't you rather be drinking?\" is dropped, when the reader is obviously interested in finding out the details - hence picking up a brewing book, dude.\n\nThe final hundred pages or so contain recipes for various brews that Papazian has crafted over the years, often with creative nicknames (\"dfhdgh\" is one of my favorites). Those recipes are reference points more than anything for advanced brewers, though, continuing with the theme of Papazian not picking out an audience (experienced or beginner) and sticking to it. There are very few all-grain recipes, a source of frustration for those who are branching out a bit.\n\nAt the end of the day, this book is a fun read, a relatively easy read, but certainly not an essential one. Don't pick it up if you're trying to learn how to brew for the first time - go with one of Papazian's other offerings. Don't pick it up if you're trying to take your brewing to serious new levels (though his breakdown of various all-grain mashing techniques is very good), either. However, as part of a more complete brewing library, or just as a fun read about homebrewing, it's worthwhile.\n\nIf you're interested in purchasing, do so through this Amazon affiliate link: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0060584734?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=yeasanddown-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060584734\">The Homebrewer's Companion<\/a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=yeasanddown-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0060584734\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" \/>","post_title":" Book Review: The Homebrewer's Companion","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"109-autosave","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-01-31 08:50:14","post_modified_gmt":"2011-01-31 13:50:14","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"109","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/01\/109-autosave\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Like any good northern kid, I have my supplies ready for a blizzard. I had a choice between a barley wine, imperial stout and imperial black ale. It's a big storm, so I decided to go with the biggest beer in my fridge, Avery Brewing Co.'s The Czar Imperial Stout.\r\n\r\nI've tried two other bombers from Avery Brewing Co. The Kaiser was very good and made me think, \"I should really try more beers from Avery.\" Then I tried The Reverend, which made me think, \"Maybe I should slow my Avery roll...\" The Czar will serve as the great tie breaker.\r\n\r\nThe company itself describes the beer:\r\n<blockquote>Behold the stunning crimson hues through the inky blackness. Inhale the noble Hallertau hops, spicy and floral. Savor the flavors redolent of English toffee, rich mocha, sweet molasses, candied currants and a hint of anise. We highly recommend cellaring additional bottles, as the Czar will continue to mature and become denser and more complex with age.<\/blockquote>\r\nThis is the perfect night for an imperial stout, and I might get to work from home tomorrow, so I'm in a good mood to try this. Here's hoping that Avery can win this round!\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_820\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"294\" caption=\"The Czar Imperial Stout - 11.69% ABV and 70IBUs\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_20110201_220518.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-820\" title=\"The Czar Imperial Stout\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_20110201_220518-e1296620548585-294x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Czar Imperial Stout\" width=\"294\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAppearance: The beer pours dark, opaque brown with a couple ruby flashes if the light hits it the right way. There was a huge, fluffy caramel head that laced down quickly. A thin layer of foam is fighting the good fight still now.\r\n\r\nAroma: I'm getting a roasty, malty sweetness, almost syrupy. There's also a stone fruit and slightly spicy note underneath the sweetness.\r\n\r\nTaste: A surprising amount of hop bitterness on the initial taste.  Lots of acrid, roasty notes early in taste. In the middle, there is a nice caramel\/toffee sweetness. It finished with some spicy hop notes and warming alcohol taste.\r\n\r\nMouthfeel: Thick, chewy and syrupy. There's not a lot of carbonation, but there's enough to keep it from being completely overwhelming. It coats the mouth and leaves a pleasant lingering alcohol tingling.\r\n\r\nOverall: This is a very easy drinking giant beer. It has a lovely, complicated flavor that warms the body and perfectly compliments this ridiculously horrible night. Avery wins this round and is sitting at 2-1.","post_title":"Review: Avery The Czar Imperial Stout","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"review-avery-the-czar-imperial-stout","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-11 08:28:22","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-11 13:28:22","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=819","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Like any good northern kid, I have my supplies ready for a blizzard. I had a choice between a barley wine, imperial stout and imperial black ale. It's a big storm, so I decided to go with the biggest beer in my fridge, Avery Brewing Co.'s The Czar Imperial Stout.\r\n\r\nI've tried two other bombers from Avery Brewing Co. The Kaiser was very good and made me think, \"I should really try more beers from Avery.\" Then I tried The Reverend, which made me think, \"Maybe I should slow my Avery roll...\" The Czar will serve as the great tie breaker.\r\n\r\nThe company itself describes the beer:\r\n<blockquote>Behold the stunning crimson hues through the inky blackness. Inhale the noble Hallertau hops, spicy and floral. Savor the flavors redolent of English toffee, rich mocha, sweet molasses, candied currants and a hint of anise.

I've traveled to many states, and though Michigan is often known as one of the most beer-friendly, that doesn't mean there are some things I'd like to see changed. Shockingly, considering the nature of this site, most of my suggestions involved loosening restrictions.\r\n<h3>Pennsylvania<\/h3>\r\nThe Keystone State was founded by Quakers, and it is notorious for its ridiculously restrictive liquor laws. Beer can only be purchased in state-run stores (for now) or to-go restaurants, and anyone who's visited Pennsylvania has been frustrated by the archaic legal restrictions.\r\n\r\nThat said, there is one thing that I've experienced in Pennsylvania that I'd like to see the State of Michigan adopt: free samples. When I visited Philadelphia in the fall, I went into a beer store (state-run, of course) and was able to try samples of several different beers. In Michigan, you can only give out free samples that are brewed on-premises, or in an establishment owned by the brewer.  The restrictions have eased up slightly since the recent legislation went through, but samples still have to be purchased (though they're now allowed to sell them at pacage liquor outlets).\r\n<h3>Illinois\/New York<\/h3>\r\nThis is certainly the case in many other states as well, but statutes limiting the closing of bar establishments to 2AM at the latest are an annoyance in Ann Arbor. In Paul's new hometown of Chicago, 4AM is the time du jour, and Nevada (particularly Las Vegas) famously has 24-hour service.  I understand some of the reasons behind this, as it's possible to be a public nuisance, and there's risk of leading to overserving patrons, but aren't there other statutes that already take care of this?\r\n\r\nIn Ann Arbor, a law passed a couple years back allowing establishments (i.e. nightclubs) to stay open until 4 if they stop serving at 2, but what purpose does that really serve?\r\n<h3>Others?<\/h3>\r\nBeer distributors are a big lobby in every state that has robust alcohol trade, and though there are some positive aspects to this (anybody who's taken Econ 101 knows about natural monopolies), but there are also problems with state-mandated exclusive distributorship.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem comes from restricting the availability of certain products in a location. If Distributor X controls Bells distribution in your area, and they don't carry Oberon, for example (oh hai Chicago, until recently), you're out of luck. The lack of Yeungling availability that your friends who are Pennsylvania ex-pats keep bitching about is another example of this - showing that it's not a Michigan-specific problem.\r\n\r\nI understand that the strong distributor lobby is going to make this tough to change, but there has to be some way to allow for exemptions that will increase the availability (and therefore sales) of craft beer across the country.\r\n\r\n<em>What else would you like to see changed?<\/em>","post_title":"Michigan Liquor Law Thoughts","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"michigan-liquor-law-thoughts","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-18 08:47:56","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-18 13:47:56","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=840","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The lack of Yeungling availability that your friends who are Pennsylvania ex-pats keep bitching about is another example of this - showing that it's not a Michigan-specific problem.\n\nI understand that the strong distributor lobby is going to make this tough to change, but there has to be some way to allow for","post_title":"Michigan Liquor Law Thoughts","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"840-revision","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-09 13:59:29","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-09 18:59:29","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"840","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/840-revision\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

A couple weeks ago, the taphouse had a release for two creations from their Dexter brewery, Collababeire and Bambic.\r\n\r\nThe release itself was hectic, with patrons lined up to purchase bottles of each beer (some of them trying to game the system to get more than the maximum - which, uncool, dude). In no hurry, I grabbed a seat at the bar, and although it took a while to be served, it certainly beat out waiting in line to not even drink the brews immediately.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_853\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Jolly Pumpkin (WSGs Stone and Nogne Ø) Collababeire\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2365.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-853\" title=\"Jolly Pumpkin Collababeire\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2365-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Jolly Pumpkin Collababeire\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nCollababeire, as the name implies, is a collaboration between Jolly Pumpkin and a couple other breweries. Stone in California and Nogne Ø from Norway were involved in the creation of this farmhouse-style ale. The three have collaborated <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2008\/11\/stone-special-holiday-ale-jolly-pumpkin-nogne-o\/\">twice<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2009\/11\/nogne-o-islay-winter-ale-highland-imperial-stout-imperial-dunkelwit\/\">before<\/a>, and this was the third leg of that relationship. Each brewery created their own beer from the same recipe, and they were blended in Dexter and aged in oak.

A couple weeks ago, the taphouse had a release for two creations from their Dexter brewery, Collababeire and Bambic.\n\nThe release itself was hectic, with patrons lined up to purchase bottles of each beer (some of them trying to game the system to get more than the maximum - which, uncool, dude). In no hurry, I grabbed a seat at the bar, and although it took a while to be served, it certainly beat out waiting in line to not even drink the brews immediately.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_853\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Jolly Pumpkin (WSGs Stone and Nogne Ø) Collababeire\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2365.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-853\" title=\"Jolly Pumpkin Collababeire\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2365-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Jolly Pumpkin Collababeire\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nCollababeire, as the name implies, is a collaboration between Jolly Pumpkin and a couple other breweries. Stone in California and Nogne Ø from Norway were involved in the creation of this farmhouse-style ale. The three have collaborated <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2008\/11\/stone-special-holiday-ale-jolly-pumpkin-nogne-o\/\">twice<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2009\/11\/nogne-o-islay-winter-ale-highland-imperial-stout-imperial-dunkelwit\/\">before<\/a>, and this was the third leg of that relationship. Each brewery created their own beer from the same recipe, and they were blended in Dexter and aged in oak. This is a \"holiday ale,\" although, as you may note, it was released well after the holidays.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_855\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Jolly Pumpkin Bambic\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2363.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-855\" title=\"Jolly Pumpkin Bambic\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2363-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Jolly Pumpkin Bambic\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nBambic is Jolly Pumpkin's Bam Biere blended with their Lambicus Dexterius (yeah, I didn't even notice until writing this post that the title referred to \"lambic..

I picked up a 330mL bottle of the Bambic and a 750mL bottle of the Collababeire, so I'll let Paul take place in the tasting before putting official thoughts to paper.","post_title":"Jolly Pumpkin Release: Bambic and Collababeire","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"850-revision-3","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-16 14:44:08","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-16 19:44:08","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"850","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/850-revision-3\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The lack of Yeungling availability that your friends who are Pennsylvania ex-pats keep bitching about is another example of this - showing that it's not a Michigan-specific problem.\n\nI understand that the strong distributor lobby is going to make this tough to change, but there has to be some way to allow for exemptions that will increase the availability (and therefore sales) of craft beer across the country.\n\n<em>What else would you like to see changed?<\/em>","post_title":"Michigan Liquor Law Thoughts","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"840-autosave","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-18 08:49:00","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-18 13:49:00","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"840","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/840-autosave\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

A couple weeks ago, the taphouse had a release for two creations from their Dexter brewery, Collababeire and Bambic.\r\n\r\nThe release itself was hectic, with patrons lined up to purchase bottles of each beer (some of them trying to game the system to get more than the maximum - which, uncool, dude). In no hurry, I grabbed a seat at the bar, and although it took a while to be served, it certainly beat out waiting in line to not even drink the brews immediately.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_853\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Jolly Pumpkin (WSGs Stone and Nogne Ø) Collababeire\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2365.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-853\" title=\"Jolly Pumpkin Collababeire\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2365-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Jolly Pumpkin Collababeire\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nCollababeire, as the name implies, is a collaboration between Jolly Pumpkin and a couple other breweries. Stone in California and Nogne Ø from Norway were involved in the creation of this farmhouse-style ale. The three have collaborated <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2008\/11\/stone-special-holiday-ale-jolly-pumpkin-nogne-o\/\">twice<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2009\/11\/nogne-o-islay-winter-ale-highland-imperial-stout-imperial-dunkelwit\/\">before<\/a>, and this was the third leg of that relationship. Each brewery created their own beer from the same recipe, and they were blended in Dexter and aged in oak. This is a \"holiday ale,\" although, as you may note, it was released well after the holidays.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_855\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Jolly Pumpkin Bambic\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2363.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-855\" title=\"Jolly Pumpkin Bambic\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2363-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Jolly Pumpkin Bambic\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nBambic is Jolly Pumpkin's Bam Biere blended with their Lambicus Dexterius (yeah, I didn't even notice until writing this post that the title referred to \"lambic.\" I'm slow). The label says \"Winking Lizard\" all over it, so one must assume this beer was created primarily for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winkinglizard.com\/\">Winking Lizard Tavern<\/a>, a chain across the state of Ohio (further research shows it's to celebrate <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2010\/12\/bambic-jolly-pumpkin-crafts-new-beer-for-winking-lizards-25th\/\">WL's 25th anniversary<\/a>).\r\n\r\nI won't talk too much about how they tasted here, but there will be full reviews coming soon. I picked up a 330mL bottle of the Bambic and a 750mL bottle of the Collababeire, so I'll let Paul take place in the tasting before putting official thoughts to paper.","post_title":"Jolly Pumpkin Release: Bambic and Collababeire","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"850-revision-4","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-16 14:44:36","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-16 19:44:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"850","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/850-revision-4\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

We plan to do the same Friday night in Grand Rapids. Who knows, maybe we'll pick up a recipe and brew a batch of our own on Friday afternoon.\r\n\r\nShould be an excellent weekend.","post_title":"Michigan Brewer's Guild Winter Festival","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"michigan-brewers-guild-winter-festival","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-23 10:14:51","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-23 15:14:51","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=879","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Wait, wait, wait: hear me out. We plan on spending Thursday night checking out what Ann Arbor has to offer, and if we can cross anything off our list ahead of time, it'll make things easier for us Saturday afternoon. We plan to do the same Friday night in Grand Rapids.

Throw in the awesome barbecue food, you've got my favorite bar in Chicago.\n<h3>I Don't Appreciate Bell's As Much As I Should<\/h3>\nI lived the first 24 years of my life in Michigan. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bellsbeer.com\/\">Bell's<\/a> has been relevant and even top dog in the craft beer scene since I started thinking, \"maybe there's something better than Bud Light...\" I've never harbored any ill-will toward Bell's, but when I saw it in the stores next to Arcadia, Founders, New Holland or Shorts, I would almost invariably pick one of the smaller guys.\n\nBeing out in Chicago, it's amazing how excited people get about Bell's releases. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chibeer.org\/\">Chicago Beer Society<\/a> Listserv I subscribed to was flooded with messages about where you could go to get Hopslam on draft or pick up a case or two. This was totally shocking to me. Back in Michigan, an average party store still has a couple six packs of Batch 9000 and Hell Hath No Fury, etc. Here in Chicago, it's a mad dash to grab it before it's gone.\n\nMoving away from Michigan has definitely helped me appreciate Bell's more. They have tons of different beers (and an incredibly impressive selection of stouts) and almost all of them are anywhere between Very Good and I Could Die Right Now And Be Happy.\n\nI'll credit it to a mixture of expatriate nostalgia and appreciation borne from seperation, but now when I see Bell's on draft, I'll snag a pint (especially Two Hearted). I usually have at least on variety of Bell's in the fridge at any given time. In getting excited to try new breweries, I let Bell's fall by the wayside, but that's not fair to them or, more importantly, to me.","post_title":"Hopslam in Chicago","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"739-revision-3","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-21 12:38:02","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-21 17:38:02","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"739","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/739-revision-3\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Throw in the awesome barbecue food, you've got my favorite bar in Chicago.\r\n<h3>I Don't Appreciate Bell's As Much As I Should<\/h3>\r\nI lived the first 24 years of my life in Michigan. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bellsbeer.com\/\">Bell's<\/a> has been relevant and even top dog in the craft beer scene since I started thinking, \"maybe there's something better than Bud Light...\" I've never harbored any ill-will toward Bell's, but when I saw it in the stores next to Arcadia, Founders, New Holland or Shorts, I would almost invariably pick one of the smaller guys.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_887\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"A selection of beers made by Bell\\'s\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/bells.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/bells-300x134.jpg\" alt=\"Bell&#039;s Beer\" title=\"Bell&#039;s Beer\" width=\"300\" height=\"134\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-887\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nBeing out in Chicago, it's amazing how excited people get about Bell's releases.

They describe it as a barley wine brewed with raisins.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_787\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"242\" caption=\"Short&#39;s The Wizard\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2304.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-787\" title=\"Short's The Wizard\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2304-242x300.jpg\" alt=\"Short's The Wizard\" width=\"242\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nThe beer has a great barleywine color and head, though it may be just a little bit darker than most barleywines. That could be due to the adjunct being dark in color, or more malt. Either way, no complaints here.\n\nThe aroma had plenty of malt, and just barely a hint of raisins - which, to be fair, don't exactly have a strong aroma themselves. The flavor was a nice deep maltiness, but again, I hardly even got a hint of the raisin flavor. If you're going to make a beer somehow \"special\" or distinct by including an adjunct, that should be present. I'm not asking for it to be overwhelming, just existent.\n\nLack of raisin flavor notwithstanding, this was an all-around mediocre beer. The malt flavors were present, but not as strong as you'd expect from a barleywine. It almost tasted a bit watered down, or more like a brown ale. Adding to that, when I was drinking it, I didn't think it tasted particularly strong, but I quickly realized that probably wasn't the case, as I got a buzz going before I was done with it. The flavor was weaker than the actual alcohol (11.0%) and malt content, which I don't regard as a positive asset.\n\nOverall, I would drink this beer again, but certainly wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it.","post_title":"Review: Short's The Wizard","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"786-revision-5","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-17 10:11:19","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-17 15:11:19","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"786","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/786-revision-5\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

A couple weeks ago, the taphouse had a release for two creations from their Dexter brewery, Collababeire and Bambic.\r\n\r\nThe release itself was hectic, with patrons lined up to purchase bottles of each beer (some of them trying to game the system to get more than the maximum - which, uncool, dude).

Stone in California and Nogne Ø from Norway were involved in the creation of this farmhouse-style ale. The three have collaborated <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2008\/11\/stone-special-holiday-ale-jolly-pumpkin-nogne-o\/\">twice<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2009\/11\/nogne-o-islay-winter-ale-highland-imperial-stout-imperial-dunkelwit\/\">before<\/a>, and this was the third leg of that relationship. Each brewery created their own beer from the same recipe, and they were blended in Dexter and aged in oak. This is a \"holiday ale,\" although, as you may note, it was released well after the holidays.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_855\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Jolly Pumpkin Bambic\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2363.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-855\" title=\"Jolly Pumpkin Bambic\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2363-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Jolly Pumpkin Bambic\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nBambic is Jolly Pumpkin's Bam Biere blended with their Lambicus Dexterius (yeah, I didn't even notice until writing this post that the title referred to \"lambic.\" I'm slow). The label says \"Winking Lizard\" all over it, so one must assume this beer was created primarily for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winkinglizard.com\/\">Winking Lizard Tavern<\/a>, a chain across the state of Ohio (further research shows it's to celebrate <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2010\/12\/bambic-jolly-pumpkin-crafts-new-beer-for-winking-lizards-25th\/\">WL's 25th anniversary<\/a>).\r\n\r\nI won't talk too much about how they tasted here, but there will be full reviews coming soon. I picked up a 330mL bottle of the Bambic and a 750mL bottle of the Collababeire, so I'll let Paul take place in the tasting before putting official thoughts to paper.","post_title":"Jolly Pumpkin Release: Bambic and Collababeire","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"850-revision-6","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-21 10:35:05","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-21 15:35:05","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"850","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/850-revision-6\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

A couple weeks ago, the taphouse had a release for two creations from their Dexter brewery, Collababeire and Bambic.\r\n\r\nThe release itself was hectic, with patrons lined up to purchase bottles of each beer (some of them trying to game the system to get more than the maximum - which, uncool, dude). In no hurry, I grabbed a seat at the bar, and although it took a while to be served, it certainly beat out waiting in line to not even drink the brews immediately.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_853\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Jolly Pumpkin (WSGs Stone and Nogne Ø) Collababeire\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2365.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-853\" title=\"Jolly Pumpkin Collababeire\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2365-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Jolly Pumpkin Collababeire\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nCollababeire, as the name implies, is a collaboration between Jolly Pumpkin and a couple other breweries. Stone in California and Nogne Ø from Norway were involved in the creation of this farmhouse-style ale. The three have collaborated <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2008\/11\/stone-special-holiday-ale-jolly-pumpkin-nogne-o\/\">twice<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2009\/11\/nogne-o-islay-winter-ale-highland-imperial-stout-imperial-dunkelwit\/\">before<\/a>, and this was the third leg of that relationship. Each brewery created their own beer from the same recipe, and they were blended in Dexter and aged in oak. This is a \"holiday ale,\" although, as you may note, it was released well after the holidays.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_855\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Jolly Pumpkin Bambic\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2363.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-855\" title=\"Jolly Pumpkin Bambic\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/IMG_2363-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Jolly Pumpkin Bambic\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nBambic is Jolly Pumpkin's Bam Biere blended with their Lambicus Dexterius (yeah, I didn't even notice until writing this post that the title referred to \"lambic.\" I'm slow). The label says \"Winking Lizard\" all over it, so one must assume this beer was created primarily for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winkinglizard.com\/\">Winking Lizard Tavern<\/a>, a chain across the state of Ohio (further research shows it's to celebrate <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2010\/12\/bambic-jolly-pumpkin-crafts-new-beer-for-winking-lizards-25th\/\">WL's 25th anniversary<\/a>).\r\n\r\nI won't talk too much about how they tasted here, but there will be full reviews coming soon. I picked up a 330mL bottle of the Bambic and a 750mL bottle of the Collababeire, so I'll let Paul take place in the tasting before putting official thoughts to paper.","post_title":"Jolly Pumpkin Release: Bambic and Collababeire","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"850-revision-7","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-21 13:52:36","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-21 18:52:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"850","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/850-revision-7\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

That's part of what makes the Brewer's Festival so much fun, right?\r\n\r\nIn order to make this easier on ourselves, we're going to drink the two preceding nights as well. Wait, wait, wait: hear me out. We plan on spending Thursday night (I'm writing this in advance because who knows how much I'll feel like writing in between sessions of debauchery) checking out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/12\/if-at-first-you-dont-enjoy\/\">what Ann Arbor has to offer<\/a> - and drinking some beer festival beers <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/jolly-pumpkin-release-bambic-and-collababeire\/\">I've already bought<\/a> - and if we can cross anything off our list ahead of time, it'll make things easier for us Saturday afternoon. We plan to do the same Friday night in Grand Rapids. Who knows, maybe we'll pick up a recipe and brew a batch of our own on Friday afternoon.\r\n\r\nShould be an excellent weekend.","post_title":"Michigan Brewer's Guild Winter Festival","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"879-revision-6","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-22 16:18:34","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-22 21:18:34","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"879","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/879-revision-6\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

As I've mentioned earlier, most bars here are catered to the generic apres ski crowd, so Bud, Coors, and Keystone (along with New Belgium's Fat Tire) dominate the taps.<\/p>\r\nThe only advantage of living here (Vail Valley specifically), in terms of beer tasting, is the alco-ma-hol stores have a great selection of CO Microbrews, and not just the common ones you see across the country, like NB's Fat Tire, or Avery's The Reverend, I'm talking the entire Odells, Oskar Blues, and New Belgium catalog, and a good chunk of Avery's selection as well. While it does take me a bit of a bus ride to get there, and another one to get back: Worth it.\r\n\r\nToday, I gathered a collection of three Belgian-style ales from CO, mostly because it's not a style (or group of styles) that I generally drink, nor is it one of my favorite groups of styles, and getting yourself into a habit of only drinking a couple types of beers is going to diminish your palette, and we can't have that, can we?\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_927\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"New Belgium&#39;s Trippel - 7.8% ABV\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/P2230734.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-927 \" title=\"New Belgium's Trippel\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/P2230734-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"7.8% ABV\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe first beer on the list was the New Belgium Trippel. This poured well, for a trip, a lingering sudsy head typical of the style that helped release the aroma of the beer. This picture makes it appear much darker than it actually is, which is a nice golden yellow. The aroma is dominated by the banana esters and maybe a hint of strawberry. Hop tones are light as is the coriander. I'd go so far as to say I had to strain hard to pick up on it.\r\n\r\nThe flavor also strongly featured the bananas with what I thought was a surprising amount of malt flavor. Sweet, but not so much as to prevent you (read: me) from rapidly consuming it. It did, however do a fantastic job of covering the flooring 7.8% ABV. I had one of these, and was definitely aware I was drinking a beer. The finish lingered enough to leave my mouth wanting another swig.\r\n\r\nThis is truly a great brew. I don't really go out of my way to drink tripels, but I can see myself (frequently) getting a six pack of this again and enjoying a couple on the mountain for a mid-day picnic once the we start getting a little warmer around here.\r\n\r\nNext on the list was New Belgium's Abbey ale. This is a dubbel ale with a bit more color to it. On my first attempt at a pour, epic fail ensued, resulting in a five finger head out of my mug, with maybe half that height in beer. It faded enough to try again in about two minutes, this time with much more success.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_929\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"New Belgium&#39;s Abbey - 7% ABV\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/P2230737.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-929 \" title=\"New Belgium's Abbey\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/P2230737-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"7% ABV\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nSignificantly darker than the trip (as one would expect), the Abbey's head laces much more, and the head settles to a thin creamy cap on a deep amber transparent base. Fewer esters in the nose here, along with a bit more malt aroma. I also picked up a significant amount of tannins in the nose. I felt like I was about to drink some bizarre cab sav.\r\n\r\nAnd on to the tasting: Boy, oh boy, getting suck in a style(or, more accurately, chronically avoiding a style) leads to some forgetfulness. My tongue doesn't remember anything but a banana smoothie that has that much banana in it. The fruitiness of the malt hides some of the more basic sugar flavors you'd expect from something this dark. Normal for the style, not so normal for me.\r\n\r\nJust as a side note, I'd like to voice my appreciation for these two NB bottles. It seems breweries are going to busier and busier labels. These are simple two tone bottles, with the name and style and a small, simple graphic. Beer doesn't need to be show-y. It's beer, you drink it. Hilariously, after buying both of these, I told Paul he'd like the design of the bottles. Paul mentioned he also had bought sixers of each, with a significant factor in his decision being the label design.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_930\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Avery&#39;s Salvation - 9% ABV\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/P2270739.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-930\" title=\"Avery's Salvation\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/P2270739-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"9% ABV\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the bomber of Avery's Salvation Belgian golden pale ale: The pour was excellent, with a soft one and a half finger head that subsided to a light dusting of eggshell white foam. Not the retention I was expecting, but the texture was decent, for a non-Belgian-aficionado like myself. The aroma had a sickly sweet fruit aroma, with a small mix of earthy and floral hop notes. It reminded me of our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/06\/a-tale-of-two-ales\/\">Lawnmower beers<\/a>: a lot going on, but nothing really coherant. I know I'm not well versed in this style, but I don't remember any Belgian anything smell like this. It's hard to get past, maybe because of my bad memories of trying to choke down the Lawnmowers so we could put something else in our kegs...\r\n\r\nOnce I got it into my mouth, it seemed to normalize a bit, and I was able to track it down a little better, but I'm not sure that's doing it any favors. The spicy pepper notes come through very strongly, drowning out most of the malt flavor. Floral hop flavor also dominates. I caught a bit of honey and maybe a lick of cruciferous veggies, cabbage, mostly. The alcohol covers up any other notes that might lead you to think this was anything but a macabre attempt at a complex, enlightened beer.\r\n\r\nWell! What an adventure! That was certainly interesting, and it ran the gamut of Beer I Loved (Tripel), Beer I Liked (Abbey), and Beer I'll Quaff, But Not Do So Enthusiastically (Salvation). Importantly, I reminded myself that some Belgians can rock my socks. It's easy to get caught up in our preferred styles. We always try that IPA we've never had before, or the new stout our beer store is carrying. That's totally fine! That's great! We drink beer because we like it. Certain styles we like more than others, so our tabs <em>should<\/em> favor those brews. I just want to emphasize the importance of not letting yourself forget what certain aspects you like and dislike about styles you might rarely drink.\r\n\r\nYour palette is like a muscle. Exercise it. Challenge it with flavors it doesn't always come across. It will make your ability to discern the various aspects of the beers you usually consume all the more. Maybe you didn't notice that the stout you always pour has a slight but now-noticeable ester presence, or that APA has some tannin notes you never got before. Expand your tongue - stretch it and flex it.","post_title":"Belgium in Colorado, OR How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love a Trippel","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"belgium-in-colorado-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-a-trippel","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-27 21:38:29","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-28 02:38:29","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=913","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"3"},

They describe it as a barley wine brewed with raisins.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_787\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"242\" caption=\"Short&#39;s The Wizard\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2304.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-787\" title=\"Short's The Wizard\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_2304-242x300.jpg\" alt=\"Short's The Wizard\" width=\"242\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe beer has a great barleywine color and head, though it may be just a little bit darker than most barleywines. That could be due to the adjunct being dark in color, or more malt. Either way, no complaints here.\r\n\r\nThe aroma had plenty of malt, and just barely a hint of raisins - which, to be fair, don't exactly have a strong aroma themselves. The flavor was a nice deep maltiness, but again, I hardly even got a hint of the raisin flavor. If you're going to make a beer somehow \"special\" or distinct by including an adjunct, that should be present. I'm not asking for it to be overwhelming, just existent.\r\n\r\nLack of raisin flavor notwithstanding, this was an all-around mediocre beer. The malt flavors were present, but not as strong as you'd expect from a barleywine. It almost tasted a bit watered down, or more like a brown ale. Adding to that, when I was drinking it, I didn't think it tasted particularly strong, but I quickly realized that probably wasn't the case, as I got a buzz going before I was done with it. The flavor was weaker than the actual alcohol (11.0%) and malt content, which I don't regard as a positive asset.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would drink this beer again, but certainly wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it.","post_title":"Review: Short's The Wizard","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"786-revision-7","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-22 16:12:50","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-22 21:12:50","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"786","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/786-revision-7\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

So, this was a beer I was really excited to try (though that's <a title=\"Winter Beer Fest – Our Reviews\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/03\/winter-beer-fest-our-reviews\/\">worked against a couple beers<\/a> in the recent past). Unfortunately, I couldn't find it in Ann Arbor - and in my search I realized there's really no good bottle shop in Ann Arbor. There are a few that are OK, but nothing that you go into expecting to find whatever you're looking for, regardless of how rare or new it is.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Paul was able to find this beer in Chicago at the always-excellent Binny's. He brought a bottle with him to Ann Arbor prior to heading back west for the <a title=\"Michigan Brewer’s Guild Winter Festival\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/michigan-brewers-guild-winter-festival\/\">Winter Beer Festival<\/a>, and we kicked off an epic, boozy weekend by trying this bad boy out.\r\n\r\nAt first, I was really taken aback by the twist-off cap. When you go through the care of sealing every bottle with wax, it seems counter-intuitive to bother with twist-offs. On the other hand, I guess the wax goes a long way to ensuring freshness, despite the less-perfect seal. Anyway, on with the show.\r\n\r\nThe beer pours plenty dark, with a nice caramel head. Since we were splitting a 12-oz. bottle, each got half a glass. On the nose, there was a ton of bourbon flavor, with vanilla and malty flavors, to go along with standard brewing malts. A very, very sweet and thick-smelling beer.\r\n\r\nThe taste... my mouth is watering just remembering what this tasted like. Tons of malt, excellent bourbon flavor. There was a surprising amount of chocolate flavor in there as well, but it was just a complement to the main malty and bourbony flavors, of course. When you're drinking it, you can tell it's a big beer, but there's not enough alcohol in the flavor that you'd guess it's a 12% beer.\r\n\r\nBasically what I'm trying to say is I really liked it.","post_title":"Arcadia Barrel Aged Shipwreck Porter ","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"arcadia-barrel-aged-shipwreck-porter","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-03-03 12:17:38","post_modified_gmt":"2011-03-03 17:17:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=923","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"4"},

I'd go so far as to say I had to strain to pick up on it.\n\nThe flavor also strongly featured the bananas with what I thought was a suprising amount of malt flavor. Sweet, but not so much as to prevent you (read: me) from rapidly consuming it. It did, however do a fantastic job of covering the flooring 7.8% ABV. I had one of these, and was definitly aware I was drinking a beer. The finish lingered enough to leave my mouth wanting another swig.\n\nThis is truely a great brew. I don't really go out of my way to drink tripels, but I can see myself (frequently) getting a six pack of this again and enjoying a couple on the mountain for a mid-day picnic once the we start getting a little warmer around here.\n\nNext on the list was New Belgium's Abbey ale. This is a dubbel ale with a bit more color to it. On my first attempt at a pour, epic fail ensued, resulting in a five finger head out of my mug, with maybe half that height in beer. It faded enough to try again in about two minutes, this time with much more success.\n\nSignificantly darker than the trip (as one would expect), the Abbey's head laces much more, and the head settles to a thin creamy cap on a deep amber transparent base. Fewer esters in the nose here, along with a bit more malt aroma. I also picked up a significant amount of tannins in the nose. I felt like I was about to drink some bizarre cab sav.\n\nAnd on to the tasting: Boy, oh boy, getting suck in a style(or, more accurately, chronically avoiding a style) leads to some forgetfulness. My tounge doesn't remember anything but a banana smoothe that has that much banana in it. The fruitiness of the malt hides some of the more basic sugar flavors you'd expect from something this dark. Normal for the style, not so normal for me.\n\nJust as a side note, I'd like to voice my appreciation for these two NB bottles. It seems breweries are going to busier and busier labels. These are simple two tone bottles, with the name and style and a small, simple graphic. Beer doesn't need to be show-y. It's beer, you drink it. Hilariously, after buying both of these, I told Paul he'd like the design of the bottles. Paul mentioned he also had bought sixers of each, with a significant factor in his decision being the label design.\n\nAnd finally, the bomber of Avery's Salvation Belgian golden pale ale: The pour was excellent, with a soft one and a half finger head that subsided to a light dusting of eggshell white foam. Not the retention I was expecting, but the texture was decent, for a non-Belgian-aficionado like myself. The aroma had a sickly sweet fruit aroma, with a small mix of earthy and floral hop notes. It reminded me of our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/06\/a-tale-of-two-ales\/\">Lawnmower beers<\/a>: a lot going on, but nothing really coherant. I know I'm not well versed in this style, but I don't remember any Belgian anything smell like this. It's hard to get past, maybe because of my bad memories of trying to choke down the Lawnmowers so we could put something else in our kegs...\n\nOnce I got it into my mouth, it seemed to normalize a bit, and I was able to track it down a little better, but I'm not sure that's doing it any favors. The spicy pepper notes come through very strongly, drowning out most of the malt flavor. Floral hop flavor also dominates. I caught a bit of honey and maybe a lick of cruciferous veggies, cabbage, mostly. The alcohol covers up any other notes that might lead you to think this was anything but a macabre attempt at a complex, enlightened beer.\n\nWell! What an adventure! That was certainly interesting, and it ran the gammet of Beer I Loved (Tripel), Beer I Liked (Abbey), and Beer I'll Quaff, But Not Do So Enthusiastically (Salvation). Importantly, I reminded myself that some Belgians can rock my socks. It's easy to get caught up in our prefered styles. We always try that IPA we've never had before, or the new stout our beer store is carrying. That's totally fine! That's great! We drink beer because we like it. Certain styles we like more than others, so our tabs <em>should<\/em> favor those brews. I just want to emphasize the importance of not letting yourself forget what certain aspects you like and dislike about styles you might rarely drink.\n\nYour palette is like a muscle. Excersise it. Challenge it with flavors it doesn't always come across. It will make your ability to decern the various aspects of the beers you usually consume all the more. Maybe you didn't notice that the stout you always pour has a slight but now-noticable ester presence, or that APA has some tannin notes you never got before. Expand your tongue - stretch it and flex it.","post_title":"Belgium in Colorado, OR How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love a Trippel","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"913-revision-4","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-27 21:15:38","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-28 02:15:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"913","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/913-revision-4\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

As I've mentioned earlier, most bars here are catered to the generic apres ski crowd, so Bud, Coors, and Keystone (along with New Belgium's Fat Tire) dominate the taps.<\/p>\r\nThe only advantage of living here (Vail Valley specifically), in terms of beer tasting, is the alco-ma-hol stores have a great selection of CO Microbrews, and not just the common ones you see across the country, like NB's Fat Tire, or Avery's The Reverend, I'm talking the entire Odells, Oskar Blues, and New Belgium catalog, and a good chunk of Avery's selection as well. While it does take me a bit of a bus ride to get there, and another one to get back: Worth it.\r\n\r\nToday, I gathered a collection of three Belgian-style ales from CO, mostly because it's not a style (or group of styles) that I generally drink, nor is it one of my favorite groups of styles, and getting yourself into a habit of only drinking a couple types of beers is going to diminish your palette, and we can't have that, can we?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/P2230734.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-927 alignright\" title=\"New Belgium's Trippel\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/P2230734-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"7.8% ABV\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>The first beer on the list was the New Belgium Trippel. This poured well, for a trip, a lingering sudsy head typical of the style that helped release the aroma of the beer. This picture makes it appear much darker than it actually is, which is a nice golden yellow. The aroma is dominated by the banana esters and maybe a hint of strawberry. Hop tones are light as is the coriander. I'd go so far as to say I had to strain hard to pick up on it.\r\n\r\nThe flavor also strongly featured the bananas with what I thought was a surprising amount of malt flavor. Sweet, but not so much as to prevent you (read: me) from rapidly consuming it. It did, however do a fantastic job of covering the flooring 7.8% ABV. I had one of these, and was definitely aware I was drinking a beer. The finish lingered enough to leave my mouth wanting another swig.\r\n\r\nThis is truly a great brew. I don't really go out of my way to drink tripels, but I can see myself (frequently) getting a six pack of this again and enjoying a couple on the mountain for a mid-day picnic once the we start getting a little warmer around here.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/P2230736.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-928 alignright\" title=\"New Belgium's Abbey, Take 1\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/P2230736-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Learn to pour, Nate\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>Next on the list was New Belgium's Abbey ale. This is a dubbel ale with a bit more color to it. On my first attempt at a pour, epic fail ensued, resulting in a five finger head out of my mug, with maybe half that height in beer. It faded enough to try again in about two minutes, this time with much more success.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/P2230737.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-929\" title=\"New Belgium's Abbey\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/P2230737-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"7% ABV\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>Significantly darker than the trip (as one would expect), the Abbey's head laces much more, and the head settles to a thin creamy cap on a deep amber transparent base. Fewer esters in the nose here, along with a bit more malt aroma. I also picked up a significant amount of tannins in the nose. I felt like I was about to drink some bizarre cab sav.\r\n\r\nAnd on to the tasting: Boy, oh boy, getting suck in a style(or, more accurately, chronically avoiding a style) leads to some forgetfulness. My tongue doesn't remember anything but a banana smoothie that has that much banana in it. The fruitiness of the malt hides some of the more basic sugar flavors you'd expect from something this dark. Normal for the style, not so normal for me.\r\n\r\nJust as a side note, I'd like to voice my appreciation for these two NB bottles. It seems breweries are going to busier and busier labels. These are simple two tone bottles, with the name and style and a small, simple graphic. Beer doesn't need to be show-y. It's beer, you drink it. Hilariously, after buying both of these, I told Paul he'd like the design of the bottles. Paul mentioned he also had bought sixers of each, with a significant factor in his decision being the label design.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/P2270739.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-930\" title=\"Avery's Salvation\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/P2270739-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"9% ABV\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>And finally, the bomber of Avery's Salvation Belgian golden pale ale: The pour was excellent, with a soft one and a half finger head that subsided to a light dusting of eggshell white foam. Not the retention I was expecting, but the texture was decent, for a non-Belgian-aficionado like myself. The aroma had a sickly sweet fruit aroma, with a small mix of earthy and floral hop notes. It reminded me of our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/06\/a-tale-of-two-ales\/\">Lawnmower beers<\/a>: a lot going on, but nothing really coherant. I know I'm not well versed in this style, but I don't remember any Belgian anything smell like this. It's hard to get past, maybe because of my bad memories of trying to choke down the Lawnmowers so we could put something else in our kegs...\r\n\r\nOnce I got it into my mouth, it seemed to normalize a bit, and I was able to track it down a little better, but I'm not sure that's doing it any favors. The spicy pepper notes come through very strongly, drowning out most of the malt flavor. Floral hop flavor also dominates. I caught a bit of honey and maybe a lick of cruciferous veggies, cabbage, mostly. The alcohol covers up any other notes that might lead you to think this was anything but a macabre attempt at a complex, enlightened beer.\r\n\r\nWell! What an adventure! That was certainly interesting, and it ran the gamut of Beer I Loved (Tripel), Beer I Liked (Abbey), and Beer I'll Quaff, But Not Do So Enthusiastically (Salvation). Importantly, I reminded myself that some Belgians can rock my socks. It's easy to get caught up in our preferred styles. We always try that IPA we've never had before, or the new stout our beer store is carrying. That's totally fine! That's great! We drink beer because we like it. Certain styles we like more than others, so our tabs <em>should<\/em> favor those brews. I just want to emphasize the importance of not letting yourself forget what certain aspects you like and dislike about styles you might rarely drink.\r\n\r\nYour palette is like a muscle. Exercise it. Challenge it with flavors it doesn't always come across. It will make your ability to discern the various aspects of the beers you usually consume all the more. Maybe you didn't notice that the stout you always pour has a slight but now-noticeable ester presence, or that APA has some tannin notes you never got before. Expand your tongue - stretch it and flex it.","post_title":"Belgium in Colorado, OR How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love a Trippel","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"913-revision-7","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-27 21:36:06","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-28 02:36:06","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"913","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/913-revision-7\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

On one of their days here, we took a trip to Breckenridge, for a change of scenery and slopes. This had the wonderful side effect of giving me a chance to visit Breckenridge Brewery and do a bit of a YB&amp;D rundown of the beers they had available at the time.\r\n\r\nBefore we could visit the brewery, however, I had to survive the slopes, which turned out to be a slightly more difficult ordeal than one would assume, being that I'm on them every day...\r\n\r\nAfter an incident involving a tree, copious amounts of blood loss, a ski patrol-led toboggan ride and a quick jaunt to the E.R. (I'll save you the gore from the pictures; this is a beer site, not a snuff blog. Needless to say, my nose was picking up iron notes, not from the beer...), we finally arrived at Breck Brewery. I had been to this place twice before, both times, with Tim. The first was our first night in town, on vacation about a year ago, and the second was a few days later, during their 'Ladies Night'. This fantastic creation involves unlimited drafts of any of their beers at no charge for those of the fairer sex, and a flat $5 cover to get the same, if you possess a Y chromosome: Score.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1013\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"432\" caption=\"&quot;I am a monument to all your sins.&quot;\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/183523_10150157113218103_781188102_8091820_2986227_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1013 \" title=\"Breck Flight\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/183523_10150157113218103_781188102_8091820_2986227_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"432\" height=\"324\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\nWhen we arrived this time, however, we were in the Apres-ski\/Happy Hour deal, featuring all of their brews (except the DIPA) for $2. I almost felt like I was back at Grizzly Peak... To start off I tried once of their rotating beers, the Baldy Brown. After about half of my pint, I realized the lack of blood in my system was having a significant effect on my tolerance, so I wisened up, and went with a full flight of the 8 beers on draft. Had I not, I felt I wouldn't have been able to try more than one more brew without serious issues, like 'staying awake'. My notes follow:\r\n\r\n<strong>Baldy Brown<\/strong>\r\n\r\nHazelnut and Grape notes in the nose, with little hop character. Lighter malt flavor than I was expecting considering the style and color. Vanilla notes and I wasn't sure if I picked up a few esters in the mouth as well. The mouthfeel was a bit fluffy for a brown. I was expecting something with slightly more weight.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vanilla Porter<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNoticably more hops here, but more in the mouth than nose. Very similar to the brown, just a bit -more- of everything, especially the vanilla. Though heavier than the brown, it seemed, again, lightweight for the style, who knows, maybe I'm just out of touch...\r\n\r\n<strong>Breck Light<\/strong>\r\n\r\nBeing that BB is in a tourist town, and gets a lot of non-beer enthusiasts through its doors, they need to cater to more general crowd, and I think this is it. Honey notes in the mouth and nose. Low malt character. A light earthy hop aroma with a slightly hoppy finish.\r\n\r\n<strong>Trademark Pale<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNice dose of floral hops in the nose. Malt blends well with the hops in the mouth. Maybe a little fructose in there as well. Nothing bad to say about this one.\r\n\r\n<strong>471 IPA (DIPA)<\/strong>\r\n\r\nStrong hit of floral and citrus hops in the nose. Also: Alcohol -both in the nose and mouth, including a little bit of a burn. A little diacetyl as well. Finished very hoppy.\r\n\r\n<strong>Avalanche Amber<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSlightly sour flavor, possibly from lactic acid addition? Earthy hop flavor but not as present in the nose. The malt flavor also was very pronounced. Tasted very dark, much darker than that color. My favorite of the night.\r\n\r\n<strong>Oatmeal Stout<\/strong>\r\n\r\nPretty high carbonation for a stout, IMHE. Got a lot of nutty malt flavor, particularly almond. Warm cherry notes in the finish. It's been a long time since I've had the only 'cherry stout' I've tried, but the flavors go well together. I'd like to experiment at some point.\r\n\r\n<strong>Agave Wheat<\/strong>\r\n\r\nHoney in both nose and mouth, agave nectar tastes exactly like honey but sweeter, so: go figure. On my note card I have 'hops and bitterness - good pairing' I must assume this means at this point the bloodloss\/alcohol was getting to me, and that I meant to say the honey and bitterness paired well together. The rest of the notes I have on this are pretty difficult to read... Maybe next time.\r\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"><dl id=\"attachment_1013\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px;\"> <dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"> <\/dt> <\/dl><\/div>","post_title":"Brewery Review: Breckenridge Brewery","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"brewery-review-breckenridge-brewery","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-03-24 23:46:56","post_modified_gmt":"2011-03-25 03:46:56","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=950","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},

The scale ranged from \"Bad\" to \"Great,\" with five total graduations. I've added a couple comments for each beer as well.\r\n\r\nReminder: If you used the app, <a title=\"Winter Beer Fest Denouement\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/03\/winter-beer-fest-denouement\/\">please comment<\/a> and tell us what you thought about it, what you'd like to see improved, etc. Hopefully in the future, we can turn it from a glorified beer list (useful in itself) into something really cool down the road.\r\n<table id=\"table_results\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Great<\/td>\r\n<td>Smoked Chili Pale Ale<\/td>\r\n<td>Odd Side Ales<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td colspan=\"3\">We're suckers for a <a title=\"Chili Pepper Beer Recipe\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/chili-pepper-beer-recipe\/\">Chili Pepper beer<\/a>, and this was an excellent entry into the field. Though many that we've tried (and all we've brewed) have been darker varieties, I'm growing more interested in a lighter variety for a chili pepper recipe. This beer wasn't too hot, but the smoke flavor came through nicely in the aftertaste.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Great<\/td>\r\n<td>Sour Plead the Fifth Stout<\/td>\r\n<td>Dark Horse Brewing Co.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td colspan=\"3\">I think this was our unanimous (voting body of 2!)

It didn't have so much of the Belgian-type sourness, but rather whiskey sourness. I found that pretty interesting, as usually you get more vanilla and malty-sweet flavors out of bourbon beers.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Good<\/td>\r\n<td>Irish-style Mint Stout<\/td>\r\n<td>Odd Side Ales<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td colspan=\"3\">Using mint in a beer is no revelation, but I don't think I've seen a mint stout before - obvious though it may seem with stouts often having coffee and chocolate involved.

It was good, but it seems that the whole purpose of the beer was \"let's make this really strong\" - a goal I don't necessarily have a problem with, but not at the expense of making it delicious.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Good<\/td>\r\n<td>Hoppopotamus American IPA<\/td>\r\n<td>Hopcat<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td colspan=\"3\">We've had this one before.

I hadn't really had many smoked beer before then, but on that day I tried the 440 Pepper Smoker from <a title=\"Original Gravity Brewing\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ogbrewing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Original Gravity<\/a>, and I was hooked. Smoke beers are definitely a weird creation. Malt that has been smoked over hardwood picks up a savory, almost meat-like flavor along with the predictable smokiness.\n\nI can see them not necessarily being for everyone. They could trend too far from what beer <em>should<\/em> taste like, but personally, I like seeing people push the boundaries of beer and coming up with different and interesting flavors. Also, I drank one of these beers along with a Diavolo sandwich from <a title=\"L'Appetito\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lappetito.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">L'Appetito<\/a>. The mix of the smoked, cured meats, spicy mustard and smokey beer was absolutely amazing.\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"attachment_946\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"O&#39;Fallons Smoked Porter\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/IMG_20110110_220656.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-946\" title=\"O'Fallons Smoked Porter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/IMG_20110110_220656-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"O'Fallons Smoked Porter\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nAppearance: Dark brown with hints of copper shining through when held up to the light. It poured with a creamy, 2 finger thick tan head that dissipated somewhat quickly and without much lacing.\n\nAroma: Savory, woody and smoky. It's like a campfire in a good, aromatic way. I've had beers that have crossed the line into cigarette butt, but this stays well away from that.\n\nTaste: The taste comes in a few waves. It begins with a nice, acrid smokiness, which is quickly followed with roasted, malty sweetness. The aftertaste is a lingering, but not unpleasant acridity.\n\nMouthfeel: This beer has a medium carbonation. I think it could be just a bit a lower, actually. That might help it feel a bit richer. As it is, it's a bit too thin.\n\nOverall: I don't know why, but I had been craving a smoked beer. This hits all the spots. I don't regret picking up a six-pack.","post_title":"Review: O'Fallon's Smoke Porter","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"709-revision-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-03-08 10:38:10","post_modified_gmt":"2011-03-08 15:38:10","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"709","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/03\/709-revision-2\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

On one of their days here, we took a trip to Breckenridge, for a change of scenery and slopes. This had the wonderful side effect of giving me a chance to visit Breckenridge Brewery and do a bit of a YB&amp;D rundown of the beers they had available at the time.\n\nBefore we could visit the brewery, however, I had to survive the slopes, which turned out to be a slightly more difficult ordeal than one would assume, being that I'm on them every day...\n\nAfter an incident involving a tree, copious amounts of blood loss, a ski patrol-led toboggan ride and a quick jaunt to the E.R. (I'll save you the gore from the pictures; this is a beer site, not a snuff blog), we finally arrived at Breck Brewery. I had been to this place twice before, both times, with Tim. The first was our first night in town, on vacation about a year ago, and the second was a few days later, during their 'Ladies Night'. This fantastic creation involves unlimited drafts of any of their beers at no charge for those of the fairer sex, and a flat $5 cover to get the same, if you possess a Y chromosome: Score.\n\nWhen we arrived this time, however, we were in the Apres-ski\/Happy Hour deal, featuring all of their brews (except the DIPA) for $2. I almost felt like I was back at Grizzly Peak... To start off I tried once of their rotating beers, the Baldy Brown. After about half of my pint, I realized the lack of blood in my system was having a significant effect on my tolerance, so I wisened up, and went with a full flight of the 8 beers on draft. Had I not, I felt I wouldn't have been able to try more than one more brew without serious issues, like 'staying awake'. My notes follow:\n\nBaldy Brown\n\nVanilla Porter\n\nBreck Light\n\nTrademark Pale\n\n471 IPA (DIPA)\n\nAvalanche Amber\n\nOatmeal Stout\n\nAgave Wheat","post_title":"Brewery Review: Breckenridge Brewery","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"950-revision","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-03-12 22:35:15","post_modified_gmt":"2011-03-13 03:35:15","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"950","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/03\/950-revision\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

This is using a very generous definition of neighborhood. While there are plenty of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.northernbrewer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">great<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midwestsupplies.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">homebrew<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.austinhomebrew.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">shops<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewing.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">online<\/a>, there are certain benefits for being able to visit the shop, interact with the people, stumble upon things you wouldn't otherwise find.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1007\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Brew And Grow is my local homebrew store in Chicago\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/brewandgrow.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1007\" title=\"Brew And Grow\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/brewandgrow-300x216.jpg\" alt=\"Brew And Grow\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWhen I started brewing, we picked up supplies from a party store that carried to aisles of homebrew supplies. We checked out a place that was a drive away, but had a much larger selection of ingredients and equipment. Finally, we ended up at Adventures in Homebrewing which, despite being about half an hour away, became our go to stop for any large shopping trip.\r\n\r\nI don't want to get into specifics and reviews of the different shops; that can be done at other times. I want to go into the things that I like to see when I head into the shop, and what separates a good place from a great local hombrew shop.\r\n<h3>Knowledgable Staff<\/h3>\r\nI was going back and forth about which aspects to lead with, but after a bit of internal debate, I decided this was the most important for someone at my level. I've been homebrewing for about 18 months. I read a ton about different ingredients, equipment and techniques. That being said, I'll be the first to admit that I can use all the help I can get when I'm putting together a recipe.\r\n\r\nWhen we were formulating the recipe for the <a title=\"Recipe: S’More Stout\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/10\/recipe-s%e2%80%99more-stout\/\" target=\"_blank\">all-grain version of our S'more Stout<\/a>, we went into the store with a basic outline of what we were going to do. Working with the staff there, we swapped out the chocolate malt and roasted barley with CarafaII, which is definitely worked with our idea. It lends similar color and roastiness with out giving that acrid, burnt taste.\r\n\r\nThat's one example, but plenty of times we've gotten yeast recommendations, tip on how to make sure we don't get our keg clogged, equipment that might help and tons of other stuff. Being able to talk through my recipe idea with someone who has been brewing for a long time almost always results in something better than I could have come up with on my own.\r\n<h3>Consistent Selection<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1005\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"252\" caption=\"These should always be in stock\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/pellets.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1005\" title=\"Hop Pellets\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/pellets.jpg\" alt=\"Hop Pellets\" width=\"252\" height=\"184\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nI know when dealing with perishable items it can be a struggle keeping the stock consistant. Also, with hops especially, there can be runs when everyone rushes out to make an Amarillo pale ale or something. That being said, it is crucial that a shop tries to minimize these outages.\r\n\r\nEspecially now, going to the hombrew shop is something I need to plan. I usually try to pick up two or three recipes at a time. It gets really annoying if the shop is out of something that's nearly a staple like Special-B malt or Wyeast 1056. There are usually alternatives, but it can be a downer when you get there and see an empty bin or shelf where what you want <em>should <\/em>be.\r\n<h3>Convenient Hours<\/h3>\r\nMaybe this is just my not being totally used to having a 9-5 (technically 8:30-5:30, I guess), but it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense having your shop open from 9am to 7pm or so. If I hustle out of work a little early, jump in a cab and tell him to step on it, I could probably get to the store with half an hour to spare. Maybe I'm naive, but honestly, how many sales happen between 10 and noon. Stay open until 9pm.  Please. I'm begging you. Maybe even be open from 10a-2pm on Sunday so I don't have to wait a week to bottle because I don't have enough caps, but that's just selfish.\r\n<h3>Bulk Grains<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1006\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"As you&#39;re measuring it out, grab a grain and try it. It&#39;s amazing how different they taste.\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/barley.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1006\" title=\"Bulk Malt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/barley-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Bulk Malt\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nI don't have a crusher at home, and I assume that most homebrewers don't. Most homebrew shops do! There's something perfectly simple about measuring the exact amount of grain you need out of a bin, mixing them all together for your recipe, running them through the crusher and being good to go. There's something maddening about having to buy a 1lb bag of a specialty malt when I only need to a quarter pound and won't be able to brew again for a while. Honestly, it's probably not that big of a deal in dollars and cents to the consumer, but I really do think it's the better way to go.\r\n<h3>New and\/or Special Items<\/h3>\r\nThese don't fall under the consistent selection heading. A great shop should be able to secure the special release yeasts from White Labs and Wyeast. A great shop should be able to get the special recipe kits. Not every time, but maybe in a rotation have the newer, weirder hops like Citra or Sorachi. Help the homebrewer explore the world of potential out there.\r\n<h3>A Sense of Community<\/h3>\r\nThis one is last, but no less important. Homebrewing is all about community. I learn a ton from talking to other homebrewers, trying their beers, having them try mine. Having the folks working at a homebrew shop be friendly and not condescending is so important. There will be people just getting started and people who have been brewing for years, but they're all excited about making beer.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I really like the idea of homebrew stores holding classes or having workshops or special guest speakers. Make it almost like a public square for the homebrewing community. Plus, how many homebrewers will walk into your store for an event and not leave with at least some sanitizer or a some priming sugar. If the law allows it, having samples from the kits you sell or recipes you provide is also a great perk that helps spark conversation and build knowledge.\r\n<h3>What Do You Think?<\/h3>\r\nAny big factor you need in your shop? Anything you disagree with?

There was a bit of gas escaping when we popped the top, but that was about all she wrote. It was barely carbonated at all. In another month or so, it should really be hitting its stride. This is also a beer that I'll be interested in trying in about a year or so. I bet it will cellar really, really well.\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\nDespite the lack of carbonation, I still really enjoyed this beer. I really like the simplicity of it. A bunch of Maris Otter, a bit of Crystal and a dash of Special B. A couple ounces of hops were added and then just the standard British Wyeast. What comes out of the bottle, though, is rich and complex. Tons of flavor and great balance between the sweetness of the malt and the heat from the alcohol (this bad boy clocked in right around 7.4%).\r\n\r\nIt did get a bit cloying as you drank through an entire glass, but I bet a bit of brightness from carbonation would really help with this. Still, overall this beer is just as good as I remembered it being when we made it 18 months ago.\r\n\r\nOne things I was a little worried about was diacetyl.  We got a bit of that buttery, slipperiness in the Two Hearted clone we made. With the high gravity of the wort and forgetting to get starter going, I was worried that might be more pronounced in the Old Ale. Luckily, I think the extra week in primary and the extended stay in secondary allowed the yeasts to clean up most of the excess diacetyl.\r\n<h3>Coming Up<\/h3>\r\nMy birthday is coming up, and brewing a beer for the occasion seems like the thing to do. I think we might try mail-ordering since getting the local homebrew store is sort of a pain. For the birthday, I'm thinking a nice RyePA (<a title=\"Amarillo Rye APA\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2009\/08\/amarillo-rye-apa\/\">unsurprising<\/a> <a title=\"Review: Waldorff Bee Sting Honey Rye\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2009\/09\/review-waldorff-bee-sting-honey-rye\/\">to anyone<\/a> <a title=\"Recipe: Red’s Rye Clone\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/06\/recipe-reds-rye-clone\/\">who has followed<\/a> <a title=\"Beer Review: Two Brothers Cane &amp; Ebel\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/10\/beer-review-two-brothers-cane-ebel\/\">this<\/a> <a title=\"Beer Review: Hop Rod Rye\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/10\/beer-review-hop-rod-rye\/\">blog<\/a>). I've heard good things about Northern Brewer, so I think I might order the <a title=\"Denny's Wry Smile Rye\" href=\"http:\/\/www.northernbrewer.com\/brewing\/wry-smile-rye-ipa-all-grain-kit.html\">Denny's Wry Smile Rye Kit <\/a>\r\n\r\nSince they do a flat shipping charge, we might as well do a bigger order. One thing we had talked about was brewing an imperial stout now for next winter.

If it weren't just a block away from a very busy 8-lane surface street, I would have felt like it was in downtown Detroit: abandoned buildings, empty lots, BOOM CASINO, BOOM BREWERY. It felt like I never left home.\r\n\r\nWalking into the building, it has a similar feel to many warehouse-turned-brewhouse establishments - though the tap room was in stages of being renovated. High ceilings, big windows into the brewhouse, and assorted varieties of seating in addition to a bar were all still present.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_964\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Bowling Alley Bar\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01930.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-964\" title=\"Bowling Alley Bar at Yard's\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01930-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Bowling Alley Bar at Yard's\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAs for the bar itself, it's apparently crafted from wood that once comprised bowling alleys. Additionally, some of the benches were once church pews, and their billiards table is some form of antique. Unfortunately, the only part of the distinctive decor captured here for posterity is the bowling alley.\r\n\r\nSo, uh, I didn't just walk into a brewery to note the decor, did I? Of course not. Onto the beers:\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_962\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Yard&#39;s Taps\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01928.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-962\" title=\"Yard's Taps\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01928-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Yard's Taps\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01929.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-963\" title=\"Revolutionary Road (or something)\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01929-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Revolutionary Road (or something)\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe taphouse had 8 beers on tap - though as you can see one of them was lacking a tapper (actually, the stout may have been poured from a beer engine elsewhere - I don't remember). The beers were decently cheap, at about 4 bucks for a pint, but the flights were a ludicrous deal - 5 bucks for four 10-oz samples. That's just a dollar for 8 ounces. Naturally, I got one of everything they had on tap:\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_961\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\" caption=\"The Flights\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01927.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-961\" title=\"Yard's Brewing: The Flights\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01927-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Yard's Brewing: The Flights\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nNone (or at least very few) of these beers are available in Michigan, so it was a good experience in tasting. The IPA and Pale Ale were standard, with the former being a little light on the hops and malt for the style (though I don't exactly drink beers right on the edge of the style most of the time).\r\n\r\nI'd had the Brawler before, though I'm nearly certain that \"pugilist\" is not an actual beer style. It, like the pales, is a little light on the flavor. That's not to say there was none, but as a hoppy brown ale, I expect a little bit more out of it. I thought the ESB was probably the best of the beers on the right-side tower. It's not necessarily my favorite style, but Yard's absolutely nailed the style. I couldn't help but think how badly we missed on it when <a title=\"ESB Recipe\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2009\/07\/128\/\">brewing our own ESB<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThe left side had a Founding Fathers theme, and was called Ales of the Revolution. The Love Stout didn't really belong with that group, but whateva, I mis-apply labels when I want. Said stout had nice chocolatey tones and a decent body, but was fairly standard. The other brews over there, however, where interesting.\r\n\r\nPoor Richard's Tavern Spruce Ale (named after Benjamin Franklin's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0880889187\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=yeasanddown-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0880889187\">Almanack of the same name<\/a>) had a lovely spruce aroma and a flavor that jumped out right away. Unfortunately, once you got that flavor, there was nothing to back it up behind. The malt profile and\/or bitterness just weren't there to accompany the spruce.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington's Tavern Porter is based on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yardsbrewing.com\/ales_general-washingtons-tavern-porter.asp\">a recipe that George Washington himself brewed<\/a>! Of course, I've <a title=\"Obama, Brewer?\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/obama-brewer\/\">mentioned Washington's brewing before<\/a>, and might explore it in this space later in the future. The beer itself lacked a little OOMPH that I look for in a porter - either with an adjunct or a depth of flavor - but since they were going for authenticity to el Presidente's brew, I can't fault the folks at Yard's.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson's Tavern Ale was a standard golden ale. Not really my cup of tea, so I don't want to criticize it, but I wouldn't order it again, most likely. Like Washington's beer, it was based on a Jefferson recipe - though <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yardsbrewing.com\/ales_thomas-jeffersons-tavern.asp\">TJ's wife took care of the brewing<\/a>. Can't fault the folks at Yard's for striving toward authenticity.\r\n\r\nIn all, I enjoyed the Yard's experience, and would certainly make a return trip next time I'm in Philadelphia. See, look how much I'm enjoying:\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_960\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\" caption=\"Good Times\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01926.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-960\" title=\"Good Times\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01926-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Tim enjoys Yard's Brewing in Philadelphia\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]","post_title":"Yard's Brewing, Philadelphia","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"yards-brewing-philadelphia","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-03-21 11:56:11","post_modified_gmt":"2011-03-21 15:56:11","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=957","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The one thing I did notice is that it had a fruity sweetness, like a lot of other European Pilsner-type beers. Pilsner Urquell, for example, springs to mind as a great example of this fruity sweetness.\r\n\r\nAll other aspects were as expected, though it was a little flatter than many American Light Lagers. The finish was clean with very little aftertaste, the mouthfeel was pretty light, almost like lightly carbonated water, and the aroma was very weak. There was a hint of that sweetness in the nose, but not as much as te flavor.","post_title":"Review: Birra Moretti","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"789-revision-5","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-02-16 15:15:45","post_modified_gmt":"2011-02-16 20:15:45","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"789","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/789-revision-5\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

If it weren't just a block away from a very busy 8-lane surface street, I would have felt like it was in downtown Detroit: abandoned buildings, empty lots, BOOM CASINO, BOOM BREWERY. It felt like I never left home.\n\nWalking into the building, it has a similar feel to many warehouse-turned-brewhouse establishments - though the tap room was in stages of being renovated. High ceilings, big windows into the brewhouse, and assorted varieties of seating in addition to a bar were all still present.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_964\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Bowling Alley Bar\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01930.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-964\" title=\"Bowling Alley Bar at Yard's\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01930-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Bowling Alley Bar at Yard's\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nAs for the bar itself, it's apparently crafted from wood that once comprised bowling alleys. Additionally, some of the benches were once church pews, and their billiards table is some form of antique. Unfortunately, the only part of the distinctive decor captured here for posterity is the bowling alley.\n\nSo, uh, I didn't just walk into a brewery to note the decor, did I? Of course not. Onto the beers:\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_962\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Yard&#39;s Taps\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01928.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-962\" title=\"Yard's Taps\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01928-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Yard's Taps\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01929.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-963\" title=\"Revolutionary Road (or something)\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01929-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Revolutionary Road (or something)\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nThe taphouse had 8 beers on tap - though as you can see one of them was lacking a tapper (actually, the stout may have been poured from a beer engine elsewhere - I don't remember). The beers were decently cheap, at about 4 bucks for a pint, but the flights were a ludicrous deal - 5 bucks for four 10-oz samples. That's just a dollar for 8 ounces. Naturally, I got one of everything they had on tap:\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_961\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\" caption=\"The Flights\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01927.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-961\" title=\"Yard's Brewing: The Flights\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01927-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Yard's Brewing: The Flights\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nNone (or at least very few) of these beers are available in Michigan, so it was a good experience in tasting. The IPA and Pale Ale were standard, with the former being a little light on the hops and malt for the style (though I don't exactly drink beers right on the edge of the style most of the time).\n\nI'd had the Brawler before, though I'm nearly certain that \"pugilist\" is not an actual beer style. It, like the pales, is a little light on the flavor. That's not to say there was none, but as a hoppy brown ale, I expect a little bit more out of it. I thought the ESB was probably the best of the beers on the right-side tower. It's not necessarily my favorite style, but Yard's absolutely nailed the style. I couldn't help but think how badly we missed on it when <a title=\"ESB Recipe\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2009\/07\/128\/\">brewing our own ESB<\/a>.\n\nThe left side had a Founding Fathers theme, and was called Ales of the Revolution. The Love Stout didn't really belong with that group, but whateva, I mis-apply labels when I want. Said stout had nice chocolatey tones and a decent body, but was fairly standard. The other brews over there, however, where interesting.\n\nPoor Richard's Tavern Spruce Ale (named after Benjamin Franklin's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0880889187\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=yeasanddown-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0880889187\">Almanack of the same name<\/a>) had a lovely spruce aroma and a flavor that jumped out right away.

The beer itself lacked a little OOMPH that I look for in a porter - either with an adjunct or a depth of flavor - but since they were going for authenticity to el Presidente's brew, I can't fault the folks at Yard's.\n\nThomas Jefferson's Tavern Ale was a standard golden ale. Not really my cup of tea, so I don't want to criticize it, but I wouldn't order it again, most likely. Like Washington's beer, it was based on a Jefferson recipe - though <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yardsbrewing.com\/ales_thomas-jeffersons-tavern.asp\">TJ's wife took care of the brewing<\/a>. Can't fault the folks at Yard's\n\nIn all, I enjoyed the Yard's experience, and would certainly make a return trip next time I'm in Philadelphia.

In addition to the weather, an advantage to walking home is that I can walk right by <a title=\"Local Option\" href=\"http:\/\/localoptionchicago.com\/\">Local Option<\/a>.

I had some silly ideas of going to the gym, and I was heading to rare beer event at Sheffield's later that night. All that said, as I walked by Local Option on the walk home, I was drawn in like a moth to the flame.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_979\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Some of the Taps at Local Option\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/local-option1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-979\" title=\"Local Option\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/local-option1-300x227.jpg\" alt=\"Local Option\" width=\"300\" height=\"227\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe place was packed with a wide assortment of beer nerds. There were the stereotypical befacialhaired folk wearing the shirt\/hoodie of their favorite brewery; there were men and women still in fancy-pants work clothes; there were DePaul students in their craft beer adolescence with a chance to try one of the pinnacles of the movement. What I'm trying to say is that it was a diverse, excited crowd all waiting for 6pm when the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foundersbrewing.com\/\">Founders<\/a> kegs would be tapped. I've <a title=\"Hopslam in Chicago\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/hopslam-in-chicago\/\">mentioned this before<\/a>, but like going to see a movie at midnight, going to special tappings and being immersed in a crowd that is buzzing with excitement for the same thing makes the wait nearly as exciting as the payoff.\r\n\r\nI grew up in Grand Rapids and still have friends and family there, so I've been lucky enough to be able to routinely go to the Founders Taphouse. Between that and the <a title=\"Michigan Brewers Guild\" href=\"http:\/\/michiganbrewersguild.businesscatalyst.com\/\">Michigan Brewers Guild<\/a> festivals, I've tried all but one beer on that list, the Canadian Breakfast Stout.\r\n\r\nThey were doing small pours (about 7-8oz) to ensure all beer nerds in attendance got the chance to try something from each 5gal keg. Even so, the Canadian Breakfast Stout was the first to kick - after only 25 minutes.

My friend and I both order the flight, but unfortunately, they only had enough Lolita for one of us. Luckily for us, the staff at <a title=\"Sheffield's Chicago\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sheffieldschicago.com\/\">Sheffield's<\/a> is awesome. The chief beer nerd brought out a bottle of Sofie for us and hung out for a while talking about the beers. It's always fun to have someone knowledgable and passionate talk about something, and he sort of led us through the four main event beers. It was the next best thing to having the brewer there talking to us, and I felt it really added something special to the event.\n\nAll five of the beers were very good, so this is really splitting hairs, but here are my official (not that that really means anything) rankings with some brief notes:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Juliet\n<ul>\n\t<li>This beer wins out because not only was it delicious, but it was also something I haven't tasted before. It had a dryness, not from the bitterness of the hops, but rather from tannins like you would find in a red wine. It had a hint of sourness to go along with a complex, fruity flavor. If you have friends who just drink wine, try finding a bottle of this and sharing it with them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\t<li>Dominique\n<ul>\n\t<li>This one didn't seem to get the same love as the others with its description being just one sentence. I guess it's relatively simple: 1) Make a belgian sour 2) Put beer in a Bourbon County Stout barrel.  But what came out of this was anything but simple. It was a mix of the fruity, spicy notes of the belgian yeast and the smoothness, vanilla and very slight bourbon notes from the barrel. This beer was close to being number 1.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\t<li>Madame Rose\n<ul>\n\t<li>There was sort of a drop off at this level. This is still a very, very good beer. The balance of the vinegary flavor, the tartness from the cherry and the notes of the yeast was very well done. I think I mentally downgraded this a bit because I tasted a very similar but more mind blowing version of this beer made by a homebrewer in our local guild.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\t<li>Lolita\n<ul>\n\t<li>This beer might have been third had we gotten a full taste and if it wasn't a bit too flat. I certainly don't need my beer to super carbonated, but I feel a bit higher level would have helped brighten and separate the flavors. They got a bit muddles as it was. I was also hoping for a bit more of a funky flavor from the brettanomyces.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\t<li>Sofie\n<ul>\n\t<li>It's sort of unfair to compare Sofie with the other sisters here. She's a very well made Belgian Golden Ale. The yeast just imparts a hugely floral and fruity flavor that is backed up by a solid, but not heavy malt body. It's good, but more standard.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\nI asked in a post back when I first moved to Chicago, \"<a title=\"Am I Spoiled?\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/12\/am-i-spoiled\/\">Am I spoiled<\/a>?\" Well… with both these places within walking distance of either work or home, as well as a <a href=\"binnys.com\">Binny's<\/a> across the street, I can safely answer that question with: Yes. Yes. A thousand times yes. I totally encourage you to keep your ear to the ground. Follow beer bars on Twitter or Facebook, sign up for the newsletter, visit often and talk to the bartenders. Whatever you need to do, find out about events. There's no better way to get excited about beer than being surrounded by other folks who are just as excited as you are!\n\nHave any of you had an awesome experience at a beer centric event?

It was the next best thing to having the brewer there talking to us, and I felt it really added something special to the event.\n\nAll five of the beers were very good, so this is really splitting hairs, but here are my official (not that that really means anything) rankings with some brief notes:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Juliet\n<ul>\n\t<li>This beer wins out because not only was it delicious, but it was also something I haven't tasted before. It had a dryness, not from the bitterness of the hops, but rather from tannins like you would find in a red wine. It had a hint of sourness to go along with a complex, fruity flavor. If you have friends who just drink wine, try finding a bottle of this and sharing it with them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\t<li>Dominique\n<ul>\n\t<li>This one didn't seem to get the same love as the others with its description being just one sentence. I guess it's relatively simple: 1) Make a belgian sour 2) Put beer in a Bourbon County Stout barrel.  But what came out of this was anything but simple. It was a mix of the fruity, spicy notes of the belgian yeast and the smoothness, vanilla and very slight bourbon notes from the barrel. This beer was close to being number 1.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\t<li>Madame Rose\n<ul>\n\t<li>There was sort of a drop off at this level. This is still a very, very good beer. The balance of the vinegary flavor, the tartness from the cherry and the notes of the yeast was very well done. I think I mentally downgraded this a bit because I tasted a very similar but more mind blowing version of this beer made by a homebrewer in our local guild.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\t<li>Lolita\n<ul>\n\t<li>This beer might have been third had we gotten a full taste and if it wasn't a bit too flat. I certainly don't need my beer to super carbonated, but I feel a bit higher level would have helped brighten and separate the flavors. They got a bit muddles as it was. I was also hoping for a bit more of a funky flavor from the brettanomyces.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\t<li>Sofie\n<ul>\n\t<li>It's sort of unfair to compare Sofie with the other sisters here. She's a very well made Belgian Golden Ale. The yeast just imparts a hugely floral and fruity flavor that is backed up by a solid, but not heavy malt body. It's good, but more standard.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\nI asked in a post back when I first moved to Chicago, \"<a title=\"Am I Spoiled?\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/12\/am-i-spoiled\/\">Am I spoiled<\/a>?\" Well… with both these places within walking distance of either work or home, as well as a <a href=\"binnys.com\">Binny's<\/a> across the street, I can safely answer that question with: Yes.

It was the next best thing to having the brewer there talking to us, and it really added something special to the event.\r\n\r\nAll five of the beers were very good, so this is really splitting hairs, but here are my official (not that that really means anything) rankings with some brief notes:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Juliet\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>This beer wins out because not only was it delicious, but it was also something I haven't tasted before. It had a dryness, not from the bitterness of the hops, but rather from tannins like you would find in a red wine. It had a hint of sourness to go along with a complex, fruity flavor. If you have friends who just drink wine, try finding a bottle of this and sharing it with them.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Dominique\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>This one didn't seem to get the same love as the others with its description being just one sentence. I guess it's relatively simple: 1) Make a belgian sour 2) Put beer in a Bourbon County Stout barrel.  But what came out of this was anything but simple. It was a mix of the fruity, spicy notes of the belgian yeast and the smoothness, vanilla and very slight bourbon notes from the barrel. This beer was close to being number 1.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Madame Rose\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>There was sort of a drop off at this level. This is still a very, very good beer. The balance of the vinegary flavor, the tartness from the cherry and the notes of the yeast was very well done. I think I mentally downgraded this a bit because I tasted a very similar but more mind blowing version of this beer made by a homebrewer in our local guild.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Lolita\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>This beer might have been third had we gotten a full taste and if it wasn't a bit too flat. I certainly don't need my beer to super carbonated, but I feel a bit higher level would have helped brighten and separate the flavors. They got a bit muddled as it was.

If it weren't just a block away from a very busy 8-lane surface street, I would have felt like it was in downtown Detroit: abandoned buildings, empty lots, BOOM CASINO, BOOM BREWERY. It felt like I never left home.\n\nWalking into the building, it has a similar feel to many warehouse-turned-brewhouse establishments - though the tap room was in stages of being renovated. High ceilings, big windows into the brewhouse, and assorted varieties of seating in addition to a bar were all still present.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_964\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Bowling Alley Bar\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01930.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-964\" title=\"Bowling Alley Bar at Yard's\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01930-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Bowling Alley Bar at Yard's\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nAs for the bar itself, it's apparently crafted from wood that once comprised bowling alleys. Additionally, some of the benches were once church pews, and their billiards table is some form of antique. Unfortunately, the only part of the distinctive decor captured here for posterity is the bowling alley.\n\nSo, uh, I didn't just walk into a brewery to note the decor, did I? Of course not. Onto the beers:\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_962\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Yard&#39;s Taps\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01928.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-962\" title=\"Yard's Taps\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01928-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Yard's Taps\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01929.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-963\" title=\"Revolutionary Road (or something)\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01929-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Revolutionary Road (or something)\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nThe taphouse had 8 beers on tap - though as you can see one of them was lacking a tapper (actually, the stout may have been poured from a beer engine elsewhere - I don't remember). The beers were decently cheap, at about 4 bucks for a pint, but the flights were a ludicrous deal - 5 bucks for four 10-oz samples. That's just a dollar for 8 ounces. Naturally, I got one of everything they had on tap:\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_961\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\" caption=\"The Flights\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01927.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-961\" title=\"Yard's Brewing: The Flights\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/DSC01927-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Yard's Brewing: The Flights\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nNone (or at least very few) of these beers are available in Michigan, so it was a good experience in tasting. The IPA and Pale Ale were standard, with the former being a little light on the hops and malt for the style (though I don't exactly drink beers right on the edge of the style most of the time).\n\nI'd had the Brawler before, though I'm nearly certain that \"pugilist\" is not an actual beer style. It, like the pales, is a little light on the flavor. That's not to say there was none, but as a hoppy brown ale, I expect a little bit more out of it. I thought the ESB was probably the best of the beers on the right-side tower. It's not necessarily my favorite style, but Yard's absolutely nailed the style. I couldn't help but think how badly we missed on it when <a title=\"ESB Recipe\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2009\/07\/128\/\">brewing our own ESB<\/a>.\n\nThe left side had a Founding Fathers theme, and was called Ales of the Revolution. The Love Stout didn't really belong with that group, but whateva, I mis-apply labels when I want. Said stout had nice chocolatey tones and a decent body, but was fairly standard. The other brews over there, however, where interesting.\n\nPoor Richard's Tavern Spruce Ale (named after Benjamin Franklin's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0880889187\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=yeasanddown-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0880889187\">Almanack of the same name<\/a>) had a lovely spruce aroma and a flavor that jumped out right away. Unfortunately, once you got that flavor, there was nothing to back it up behind. The malt profile and\/or bitterness just weren't there to accompany the spruce.\n\nGeneral Washington's Tavern Porter is based on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yardsbrewing.com\/ales_general-washingtons-tavern-porter.asp\">a recipe that George Washington himself brewed<\/a>! Of course, I've <a title=\"Obama, Brewer?\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/02\/obama-brewer\/\">mentioned Washington's brewing before<\/a>, and might explore it in this space later in the future. The beer itself lacked a little OOMPH that I look for in a porter - either with an adjunct or a depth of flavor - but since they were going for authenticity to el Presidente's brew, I can't fault the folks at Yard's.\n\nThomas Jefferson's Tavern Ale was a standard golden ale. Not really my cup of tea, so I don't want to criticize it, but I wouldn't order it again, most likely. Like Washington's beer, it was based on a Jefferson recipe - though <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yardsbrewing.com\/ales_thomas-jeffersons-tavern.asp\">TJ's wife took care of the brewing<\/a>.

That being said, it is crucial that a shop tries to minimize these outages.\n\nEspecially now, going to the hombrew shop is something I need to plan. I usually try to pick up two or three recipes at a time. It gets really annoying if the shop is out of something that's nearly a staple like Special-B malt or Wyeast 1056.

If I hustle out of work a little early, jump in a cab and tell him to step on it, I could probably get to the store with half an hour to spare. Maybe I'm naive, but honestly, how many sales happen between 10 and noon. Stay open until 9pm.  Please. I'm begging you. Maybe even be open from 10a-2pm on Sunday so I don't have to wait a week to bottle because I don't have enough caps, but that's just selfish.\n<h3>Bulk Grains<\/h3>\nI don't have a crusher at home, and I assume that most homebrewers don't. Most homebrew shops do! There's something perfectly simple about measuring the exact amount of grain you need out of a bin, mixing them all together for your recipe, running them through the crusher and being good to go. There's something maddening about having to buy a 1lb bag of a specialty malt when I only need to a quarter pound and won't be able to brew again for a while. Honestly, it's probably not that big of a deal in dollars and cents to the consumer, but I really do think it's the better way to go.\n<h3>New and\/or Special Items<\/h3>\nThese don't fall under the consistent selection heading. A great shop should be able to secure the special release yeasts from White Labs and Wyeast. A great shop should be able to get the special recipe kits. Not every time, but maybe in a rotation have the newer, weirder hops like Citra or Sorachi. Help the homebrewer explore the world of potential out there.\n<h3>A Sense of Community<\/h3>\nThis one is last, but no less important. Homebrewing is all about community. I learn a ton from talking to other homebrewers, trying their beers, having them try mine. Having the folks working at a homebrew shop be friendly and not condescending is so important. There will be people just getting started and people who have been brewing for years, but they're all excited about making beer.\n\nAdditionally, I really like the idea of homebrew stores holding classes or having workshops or special guest speakers. Make it almost like a public square for the homebrewing community. Plus, how many homebrewers will walk into your store for an event and not leave with at least some sanitizer or a some priming sugar.

The only explanation I can possibly come up is that I unconsciously associated it with Mexican beer, of which I'm not a huge fan.\r\n\r\nAnyway, on an unseasonably warm day, I walked into my local bottle shop looking for an IPA. After a winter of Barley Wines and Stouts, I was really looking forward to something hoppy and bright. I ended up picking up a six pack of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lagunitas.com\/beers\/maximus.html\">Lagunitas Maximus<\/a>. I was hooked. Later I picked up a six pack of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lagunitas.com\/beers\/littlesumpin.html\">Little Sumpin' Sumpin'<\/a> ale, which is an amazing, highly hopped wheat beer. Perfect for a warm, sunny day.\r\n\r\nWell, as I was checking out bombers to pick out for this review, I lingered in the Lagunitas area and say the <a title=\"In the blue area... 2 down on the right\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lagunitas.com\/beers\/index.html\">Wilco Tango Foxtrot<\/a> (if you know your military letter call signs, you know this translates to WTF). So, clever name: check. The subtitle is making a joke about the economy and economic policy; the part of me that remembers that I have political science degree swooned. I was sold.\r\n\r\nLagunitas' description?\r\n<blockquote>This Beer was Supposed to Follow Up the 2009 Correction Ale with the Name ‘2010 Recovery Ale’, And Here in 2011 it STILL Doesn’t Look Like We’ll Be There Anytime Soon. Wonderin &amp; wonderin’..... WTF?\r\n\r\nABV: 7.83%<\/blockquote>\r\nTell me again why it took me so long to try Lagunitas?\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\n<strong>Appearance: <\/strong>The beer pours a dark but remarkably clear, coppery red with a one finger, off white head that dissipated quickly to a thin layer on top that laces gently down the glass.\r\n\r\n<strong>Aroma:<\/strong> The aroma is very hop forward. This stupid cold is sort of hampering my ability to get subtleties (thanks Chicago!), but it seems more piney and floral rather than the citrus and grapefruit I find in many heavily hopped, West coast ales. There's just a hint of the roastiness underneath hops, but very faint.\r\n\r\n<strong>Taste: <\/strong>The taste starts out with an intense resiny and piney hop bitterness. Amazingly, the roasted malt that peaked out in the aroma manages to come through after that bitterness and provide a respite. After the malt there's a coating feeling from the alcohol that leaves a bit of bitterness and some heat. It's more obviously sequential than what I'm used to. The waves of flavor are amazingly discrete.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mouthfeel:<\/strong> There isn't a lot of carbonation, but it is just perfect for this beer. I think the best way to describe it is smooth. The beer has a medium body, but it's so silky.  This goes down a bit easy for a beer that's almost 8%.\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall:<\/strong> A lot of times, I get a little turned off by \"Hopped Up [style that is generally not hoppy]*.\" A lot of times it seems like the balance is off or the essential character of the original style is lost.

{"ID":"1004","post_author":"2","post_date":"2011-03-22 23:49:20","post_date_gmt":"2011-03-23 03:49:20","post_content":"<h2>Lagunita Wilco Tango Foxtrot<\/h2>\n<h3>A Malty, Robust , Jobless Recovery Ale<\/h3>\nI've written back on my home blog about how I inexplicably avoid certain breweries when I'm at my local bottle shop. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lagunitas.com\/\">Lagunitas<\/a> was one of these breweries. The only explanation I can possibly come up is that I unconsciously associated it with Mexican beer, of which I'm not a huge fan.\n\nAnyway, on an unseasonably warm day, I walked into my local bottle shop looking for an IPA. After a winter of Barley Wines and Stouts, I was really looking forward to something hoppy and bright. I ended up picking up a six pack of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lagunitas.com\/beers\/maximus.html\">Lagunitas Maximus<\/a>. I was hooked. Later I picked up a six pack of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lagunitas.com\/beers\/littlesumpin.html\">Little Sumpin' Sumpin'<\/a> ale, which is an amazing, highly hopped wheat beer. Perfect for a warm, sunny day.\n\nWell, as I was checking out bombers to pick out for this review, I lingered in the Lagunitas area and say the <a title=\"In the blue area... 2 down on the right\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lagunitas.com\/beers\/index.html\">Wilco Tango Foxtrot<\/a> (if you know your military letter call signs, you know this translates to WTF). So, clever name: check. The subtitle is making a joke about the economy and economic policy; the part of me that remembers that I have political science degree swooned. I was sold.\n\nLagunitas' description?\n<blockquote>This Beer was Supposed to Follow Up the 2009 Correction Ale with the Name ‘2010 Recovery Ale’, And Here in 2011 it STILL Doesn’t Look Like We’ll Be There Anytime Soon. Wonderin &amp; wonderin’..... WTF?\n\nABV: 7.83%<\/blockquote>\nTell me again why it took me so long to try Lagunitas?\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\n<strong>Appearance: <\/strong>The beer pours a dark but remarkably clear, coppery red with a one finger, off white head that dissipated quickly to a thin layer on top that laces gently down the glass.\n\n<strong>Aroma:<\/strong> The aroma is very hop forward. This stupid cold is sort of hampering my ability to get subtleties (thanks Chicago!), but it seems more piney and floral rather than the citrus and grapefruit I find in many heavily hopped, West coast ales. There's just a hint of the roastiness underneath hops, but very faint.\n\n<strong>Taste: <\/strong>The taste starts out with an intense resiny and piney hop bitterness. Amazingly, the roasted malt that peaked out in the aroma manages to come through after that bitterness and provide a respite. After the malt there's a coating feeling from the alcohol that leaves a bit of bitterness and some heat. It's more obviously sequential than what I'm used to. The waves of flavor are amazingly discrete.\n\n<strong>Mouthfeel:<\/strong> There isn't a lot of carbonation, but it is just perfect for this beer. I think the best way to describe it is smooth. The beer has a medium body, but it's so silky.  This goes down a bit easy for a beer that's almost 8%.\n\n<strong>Overall:<\/strong> A lot of times, I get a little turned off by \"Hopped Up [style that is generally not hoppy]*.\" A lot of times it seems like the balance is off or the essential character of the original style is lost. Brown ales seem sort of malleable enough that this works, and they kept that caramel, roastiness that I look for in browns. This is a good beer. Pick it up before the economy gets too good.\n\n*The current trend seems to be to take an APA or IPA and fermenting it with a belgian yeast.","post_title":"AToTB Review: Lagunita WTF","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"1003-revision","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-03-22 23:49:20","post_modified_gmt":"2011-03-23 03:49:20","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"1003","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/03\/1003-revision\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

I've been homebrewing for about 18 months. I read a ton about different ingredients, equipment and techniques. That being said, I'll be the first to admit that I can use all the help I can get when I'm putting together a recipe.\n\nWhen we were formulating the recipe for the <a title=\"Recipe: S’More Stout\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/10\/recipe-s%e2%80%99more-stout\/\" target=\"_blank\">all-grain version of our S'more Stout<\/a>, we went into the store with a basic outline of what we were going to do.

There's something maddening about having to buy a 1lb bag of a specialty malt when I only need to a quarter pound and won't be able to brew again for a while.

Plus, how many homebrewers will walk into your store for an event and not leave with at least some sanitizer or a some priming sugar. If the law allows it, having samples from the kits you sell or recipes you provide is also a great perk that helps spark conversation and build knowledge.\n<h3>What Do You Think?<\/h3>\nAny big factor you need in your shop?

There are usually alternatives, but it can be a downer when you get there and see an empty bin or shelf where what you want <em>should <\/em>be.\r\n<h3>Convenient Hours<\/h3>\r\nMaybe this is just my not being totally used to having a 9-5 (technically 8:30-5:30, I guess), but it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense having your shop open from 9am to 7pm or so. If I hustle out of work a little early, jump in a cab and tell him to step on it, I could probably get to the store with half an hour to spare. Maybe I'm naive, but honestly, how many sales happen between 10 and noon. Stay open until 9pm.  Please. I'm begging you. Maybe even be open from 10a-2pm on Sunday so I don't have to wait a week to bottle because I don't have enough caps, but that's just selfish.\r\n<h3>Bulk Grains<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1006\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"As your measuring it out, grab a grain and try it.

Most homebrew shops do! There's something perfectly simple about measuring the exact amount of grain you need out of a bin, mixing them all together for your recipe, running them through the crusher and being good to go. There's something maddening about having to buy a 1lb bag of a specialty malt when I only need to a quarter pound and won't be able to brew again for a while. Honestly, it's probably not that big of a deal in dollars and cents to the consumer, but I really do think it's the better way to go.\r\n<h3>New and\/or Special Items<\/h3>\r\nThese don't fall under the consistent selection heading. A great shop should be able to secure the special release yeasts from White Labs and Wyeast. A great shop should be able to get the special recipe kits. Not every time, but maybe in a rotation have the newer, weirder hops like Citra or Sorachi. Help the homebrewer explore the world of potential out there.\r\n<h3>A Sense of Community<\/h3>\r\nThis one is last, but no less important. Homebrewing is all about community. I learn a ton from talking to other homebrewers, trying their beers, having them try mine. Having the folks working at a homebrew shop be friendly and not condescending is so important. There will be people just getting started and people who have been brewing for years, but they're all excited about making beer.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I really like the idea of homebrew stores holding classes or having workshops or special guest speakers. Make it almost like a public square for the homebrewing community. Plus, how many homebrewers will walk into your store for an event and not leave with at least some sanitizer or a some priming sugar. If the law allows it, having samples from the kits you sell or recipes you provide is also a great perk that helps spark conversation and build knowledge.\r\n<h3>What Do You Think?<\/h3>\r\nAny big factor you need in your shop?

This is using a very generous definition of neighborhood. While there are plenty of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.northernbrewer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">great<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midwestsupplies.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">homebrew<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.austinhomebrew.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">shops<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewing.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">online<\/a>, there are certain benefits for being able to visit the shop, interact with the people, stumble upon things you wouldn't otherwise find.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1007\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Brew And Grow is my local homebrew store in Chicago\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/brewandgrow.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1007\" title=\"Brew And Grow\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/brewandgrow-300x216.jpg\" alt=\"Brew And Grow\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWhen I started brewing, we picked up supplies from a party store that carried to aisles of homebrew supplies. We checked out a place that was a drive away, but had a much larger selection of ingredients and equipment. Finally, we ended up at Adventures in Homebrewing which, despite being about half an hour away, became our go to stop for any large shopping trip.\r\n\r\nI don't want to get into specifics and reviews of the different shops; that can be done at other times. I want to go into the things that I like to see when I head into the shop, and what separates a good place from a great local hombrew shop.\r\n<h3>Knowledgable Staff<\/h3>\r\nI was going back and forth about which aspects to lead with, but after a bit of internal debate, I decided this was the most important for someone at my level. I've been homebrewing for about 18 months. I read a ton about different ingredients, equipment and techniques. That being said, I'll be the first to admit that I can use all the help I can get when I'm putting together a recipe.\r\n\r\nWhen we were formulating the recipe for the <a title=\"Recipe: S’More Stout\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/10\/recipe-s%e2%80%99more-stout\/\" target=\"_blank\">all-grain version of our S'more Stout<\/a>, we went into the store with a basic outline of what we were going to do. Working with the staff there, we swapped out the chocolate malt and roasted barley with CarafaII, which is definitely worked with our idea. It lends similar color and roastiness with out giving that acrid, burnt taste.\r\n\r\nThat's one example, but plenty of times we've gotten yeast recommendations, tip on how to make sure we don't get our keg clogged, equipment that might help and tons of other stuff. Being able to talk through my recipe idea with someone who has been brewing for a long time almost always results in something better than I could have come up with on my own.\r\n<h3>Consistent Selection<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1005\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"252\" caption=\"These should always be in stock\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/pellets.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1005\" title=\"Hop Pellets\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/pellets.jpg\" alt=\"Hop Pellets\" width=\"252\" height=\"184\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nI know when dealing with perishable items it can be a struggle keeping the stock consistant. Also, with hops especially, there can be runs when everyone rushes out to make an Amarillo pale ale or something. That being said, it is crucial that a shop tries to minimize these outages.\r\n\r\nEspecially now, going to the hombrew shop is something I need to plan. I usually try to pick up two or three recipes at a time. It gets really annoying if the shop is out of something that's nearly a staple like Special-B malt or Wyeast 1056.

On one of their days here, we took a trip to Breckenridge, for a change of scenery and slopes. This had the wonderful side effect of giving me a chance to visit Breckenridge Brewery and do a bit of a YB&amp;D rundown of the beers they had available at the time.\n\nBefore we could visit the brewery, however, I had to survive the slopes, which turned out to be a slightly more difficult ordeal than one would assume, being that I'm on them every day...\n\nAfter an incident involving a tree, copious amounts of blood loss, a ski patrol-led toboggan ride and a quick jaunt to the E.R. (I'll save you the gore from the pictures; this is a beer site, not a snuff blog. Needless to say, my nose was picking up iron notes, not from the beer...), we finally arrived at Breck Brewery. I had been to this place twice before, both times, with Tim. The first was our first night in town, on vacation about a year ago, and the second was a few days later, during their 'Ladies Night'. This fantastic creation involves unlimited drafts of any of their beers at no charge for those of the fairer sex, and a flat $5 cover to get the same, if you possess a Y chromosome: Score.\n\nWhen we arrived this time, however, we were in the Apres-ski\/Happy Hour deal, featuring all of their brews (except the DIPA) for $2. I almost felt like I was back at Grizzly Peak... To start off I tried once of their rotating beers, the Baldy Brown. After about half of my pint, I realized the lack of blood in my system was having a significant effect on my tolerance, so I wisened up, and went with a full flight of the 8 beers on draft. Had I not, I felt I wouldn't have been able to try more than one more brew without serious issues, like 'staying awake'. My notes follow:\n\n<strong>Baldy Brown<\/strong>\n\nHazelnut and Grape notes in the nose, with little hop character. Lighter malt flavor than I was expecting considering the style and color. Vanilla notes and I wasn't sure if I picked up a few esters in the mouth as well. The mouthfeel was a bit fluffy for a brown. I was expecting something with slightly more weight.\n\n<strong>Vanilla Porter<\/strong>\n\nNoticably more hops here, but more in the mouth than nose. Very similar to the brown, just a bit -more- of everything, especially the vanilla. Though heavier than the brown, it seemed, again, lightweight for the style, who knows, maybe I'm just out of touch...\n\n<strong>Breck Light<\/strong>\n\nBeing that BB is in a tourist town, and gets a lot of non-beer enthusiasts through its doors, they need to cater to more general crowd, and I think this is it. Honey notes in the mouth and nose. Low malt character. A light earthy hop aroma with a slightly hoppy finish.\n\n<strong>Trademark Pale<\/strong>\n\nNice dose of floral hops in the nose. Malt blends well with the hops in the mouth. Maybe a little fructose in there as well. Nothing bad to say about this one.\n\n<strong>471 IPA (DIPA)<\/strong>\n\nStrong hit of floral and citrus hops in the nose. Also: Alcohol -both in the nose and mouth, including a little bit of a burn. A little diacetyl as well. Finished very hoppy.\n\n<strong>Avalanche Amber<\/strong>\n\nSlightly sour flavor, possibly from lactic acid addition? Earthy hop flavor but not as present in the nose. The malt flavor also was very pronounced. Tasted very dark, much darker than that color. My favorite of the night.\n\n<strong>Oatmeal Stout<\/strong>\n\nPretty high carbonation for a stout, IMHE. Got a lot of nutty malt flavor, particularly almond. Warm cherry notes in the finish. It's been a long time since I've had the only 'cherry stout' I've tried, but the flavors go well together. I'd like to experiment at some point.\n\n<strong>Agave Wheat<\/strong>\n\nHoney in both nose and mouth, agave nectar tastes exactly like honey but sweeter, so: go figure. On my note card I have 'hops and bitterness - good pairing' I must assume this means at this point the bloodloss\/alcohol was getting to me, and that I meant to say the honey and bitterness paired well together.

The conspiracy theorists are out in full force, with accusations that Big Beer (those are scare-tactic capital letters) <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2011\/03\/no-reservations-anthony-bourdain-big-beer-threatened-to-pull-ads-on-dogfish-headdiscovery-deal\/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=no-reservations-anthony-bourdain-big-beer-threatened-to-pull-ads-on-dogfish-headdiscovery-deal\">killed the show<\/a>. Of course, there have been retractions and\/or <a href=\"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/~r\/Beerscribecom\/~3\/N5vwS3zKAzs\/\">clarifications<\/a> of that accusation, and even some denials by Big Beer.\r\n\r\nSo what if they didn't kill the show? Maybe it was canceled because, quite frankly, it wasn't a very good show. And if I, as a beer lover (at least enough to write a blog about the stuff, right?) didn't think the show was very good, what does the average American think about it? Perhaps advertisers simply pulled their ads because they weren't reaching a wide audience.\r\n\r\nWas the show unsalvageable? No. But if it's going to develop into a worthwhile piece of television, it needs to take fewer than 6 episodes to \"find itself.\" I saved all the broadcast episodes on DVR, and in the name of clearing space, watched them one final time. That inspired this post, obviously, and also made me think about what could have made Brew Masters a much better show:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Everything felt like the \"first episode.\" A little exposition for new viewers is fine, but every episode felt like I was watching a pilot. That may be because the first two episodes seemingly aired out of order (\"Punkin and Portamarillo\" was certainly intended to be the pilot, but it aired after \"Bitches Brew\"), but the problem didn't get much better as the first season went on. Breaking chronology throughout the season–we saw the treehouse in the first several episodes, then it suddenly arrives, brand-new, at the facility–only added to this effect.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Too much focus on artificially-created (or just uninteresting) drama. If a batch of beer has improperly fermented, that's interesting, and is making the plot revolve around beer. If a machine breaks and drops a component into a mystery bottle, or (ugh) a factory worker spills glue, it is crap. YOU ARE NOT MAKING COMPELLING TV if you're focusing on such facile and shallow storylines. You ordered the wrong bottles. Great. What in the world made you think I'd watch an hour of TV revolving around that plot point? That's Factory Drama X, and takes the show away from beer - its raison d'etre.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Didn't let Sam be Sam. A big part of the reason Dogfish Head is so well-known (aside from the beer, of course) is the cult of personality that Sam Calagione has. He's a personable guy, and just watching him in, for example, Beer Wars, you wanted to befriend the guy. Let him show his personality in the show. Having him narrate was a gross miscalculation, because it took him from \"guy the show is about\" (good), to \"guy who makes the show\" (bad, removes his personality). Using testimonial-style narration with the employees - and even Sam - would have been a much better choice. On the same note, have one of his brewing experts - Brian and\/or Floris, for example - talk about the science and process behind the beer, not Sam himself.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>This one might directly contradict the previous point, but I don't care, because it's super-important: Don't rap. The Pain Relievaz sequences were painfully awkward.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Personal drama is alright. However, it has to revolve around interesting points. \"Sam is kinda neglecting his family on vacation\" is not interesting. Sure, it warrants a mention, but not an entire sequence. Same with \"OMG THE SCHEDULE IS SOOOOO CRUNCHED!!!\" Mention it, and move on. You aren't creating a true sense of urgency with that; if you couldn't finish the beer within your timeline, you wouldn't have an episode about it.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>This problem would be solved be resolving some of the above, but... too many storylines at once. Jumping around with no cohesion to the episode was a consistent problem. Of course, if we don't have OMG SPILLED TEH GLUEZ plots, this problem disappears.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Lastly (and this kind of ties these points together), the storylines need to be not only about the beer (see above), but also interesting. Sam's trip to Peru to study Chicha was a very interesting story. His trip to Egypt was also alright. The inspirations for these beers should be 50% of the content of the show, not 5%.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAt the beginning of each episode, Sam Calagione said, \"Every great beer starts with a great idea.\" That should be the purpose of the show - and at times it was.  Too frequently, however, it was about day-to-day drama that was unrelated or barely related to the beer. If I want to watch \"American Workplace Reality Drama,\" I can do that in a myriad of places. If I want to watch \"well-made show about the production of craft beer,\" well... that show hasn't been done yet.","post_title":"What Killed Brew Masters?","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"what-killed-brew-masters","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-04-04 18:19:40","post_modified_gmt":"2011-04-04 22:19:40","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=1029","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The network chose not to renew the show after its first season. The conspiracy theorists are out in full force, with accusations that Big Beer (those are scare-tactic capital letters) <a href=\"http:\/\/beernews.org\/2011\/03\/no-reservations-anthony-bourdain-big-beer-threatened-to-pull-ads-on-dogfish-headdiscovery-deal\/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=no-reservations-anthony-bourdain-big-beer-threatened-to-pull-ads-on-dogfish-headdiscovery-deal\">killed the show<\/a>. Of course, there have been retractions and\/or <a href=\"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/~r\/Beerscribecom\/~3\/N5vwS3zKAzs\/\">clarifications<\/a> of that accusation, and even some denials by Big Beer.\n\nSo, what if they didn't kill the show? Maybe it was cancelled because, quite frankly, it wasn't a very good show. And if I, as a beer lover (at least enough to write a blog about the stuff, right?) think that the show wasn't very good, what does the average American think about it? Perhaps advertisers simply pulled their ads because they weren't reaching a wide audience.\n\nWas the show unsalvageable? No. But if it's going to be a worthwhile piece of television, it needs to take fewer than 6 episodes to \"find itself.\" I saved all the broadcast episodes on DVR, and in the name of clearing space, am watching them one final time. That inspired this post, obviously, and also made me think about what could have made Brew Masters a much better show:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Everything felt like the \"first episode.\" A little exposition for new viewers is fine, but every episode felt like I was watching a pilot. That may be because the first two episodes seemingly aired out of order (\"Punkin and Portamarillo\" was certainly intended to be the pilot, but it aired after \"Bitches Brew\"), but the problem didn't get much better as the first season went on. Breaking chronology throughout the season - we saw the treehouse in the first several episodes, then it suddenly arrives, brand-new, at the facility - only added to this effect.<\/li>\n\t<li>Too much focus on artificially-created (or just uninteresting) drama. If a batch of beer has improperly fermented, that's interesting, and is making the plot revolve around beer. If a machine breaks and drops a component into a mystery bottle, or (ugh) a factory worker spills glue, it is crap. YOU ARE NOT MAKING COMPELLING TV if you're focusing on such facile and shallow storylines. You ordered the wrong bottles. Great. What in the world made you think I'd watch an hour of TV revolving around that plot point? That's Factory Drama X, and takes the show away from beer - its raison d'etre.<\/li>\n\t<li>Didn't let Sam be Sam. A big part of the reason Dogfish Head is so well-known (aside from the beer, of course) is the cult of personality that Sam Calagione has. He's a personable guy, and just watching him in, for example, Beer Wars, you wanted to befriend the guy. Let him show his personality in the show. Having him narrate was a gross miscalculation, because it took him from \"guy the show is about\" (good), to \"guy who makes the show\" (bad, removes his personality). Using testimonial-style narration with the employees - and even Sam - would have been a much better choice. On the same note, have one of his brewing experts - Brian and\/or Floris, for example - talk about the science and process behind the beer, not Sam<\/li>\n\t<li>This one might directly contradict the previous point, but I don't care, because it's super-important: Don't rap. The Pain Relievaz sequences were painfully awkward.<\/li>\n\t<li>Personal drama is alright. However, it has to revolve around interesting points. \"Sam is kinda neglecting his family on vacation\" is not interesting. Sure, it warrants a mention, but not an entire sequence. Same with \"OMG THE SCHEDULE IS SOOOOO CRUNCHED!!!\" Mention it, and move on. You aren't creating a true sense of urgency with that; if you couldn't finish the beer within your timeline, you wouldn't have an episode about it.<\/li>\n\t<li>Lastly (and this kind of ties these points together), the storylines need to be not only about the beer (see above), but also interesting. Sam's trip to Peru to study Chicha was a very interesting story. His trip to Egypt was also alright. The inspirations for these beers should be 50% of the content of the show, not 5%.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nAt the beginning of each episode, Sam Calagione said, \"Every great beer starts with a great idea.\" That should be the purpose of the show - and at times it was.  Too frequently, however, it was about day-to-day drama that was tangential to the beer. If I want to watch \"American Workplace Reality Drama,\" I can do that in a myriad of places. If I want to watch \"cool show about beer being made,\" well... that show hasn't been done yet.","post_title":"What Killed Brew Masters?","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"1029-revision","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-04-04 18:06:59","post_modified_gmt":"2011-04-04 22:06:59","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"1029","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/04\/1029-revision\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

If a machine breaks and drops a component into a mystery bottle, or (ugh) a factory worker spills glue, it is crap. YOU ARE NOT MAKING COMPELLING TV if you're focusing on such facile and shallow storylines. You ordered the wrong bottles. Great. What in the world made you think I'd watch an hour of TV revolving around that plot point?

A big part of the reason Dogfish Head is so well-known (aside from the beer, of course) is the cult of personality that Sam Calagione has. He's a personable guy, and just watching him in, for example, Beer Wars, you wanted to befriend the guy. Let him show his personality in the show.

There were about 10 beers on tap, ranging from the ordinary (Poet Stout, which you can pick up at pretty much any grocery store in the state) to the ordinary-but-on-Firkin (Dragon's Milk), to those I'd never seen before (Charkoota Rye).\r\n<h3>Night Tripper<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1062\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"New Holland Night Tripper\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2904.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1062\" title=\"New Holland Night Tripper\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2904-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"New Holland Night Tripper\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nImperial Stout (10.8% ABV) Tastes really strong, there's plenty of alcohol in the flavor. Really roasty with some chocolate notes. Pretty darn malty sweet (as imperial stouts, especially Russian Impoerial Stouts, often are). I would almost say it could have been fermented a little more to a lower final gravity to dry it out a bit, but it's already bordering on liquorbeer, so upping the alcohol content is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Dragon's Milk Firkin<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1063\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"New Holland Dragon&#39;s Milk (Firkin)\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2905.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1063\" title=\"New Holland Dragon's Milk (Firkin)\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2905-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"New Holland Dragon's Milk (Firkin)\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAs beers served on firkin always are, this was warm, and it was flat as well. After the Night Tripper, it almost tastes bland (though it's one of my favorite beers usually). I think the Firkin really damps a bit of the aroma, partially because there's less carbonation maybe. Hardly get anything on the nose, very light on the vanilla, a nice roasty smell. Tastes a little hot in the back of the mouth, and you definitely get the barrel-aged flavor. Not necessarily bad, but I'm used to (loving) the beer as normally served.\r\n<h3>Envious<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1064\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"New Holland Envious\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2908.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1064\" title=\"New Holland Envious\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2908-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"New Holland Envious\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nNot what I expected. Ingredients listed as pears and raspberries, I was expecting something relatively light in color or even a wheat, but it had a nice deep mahogany (my apartment smells of it) color. A little fruit on the nose - all pear. In the flavor, mostly pear, but I definitely see where the \"slumber on oak\" with raspberries comes in. Not as tart as the description led me to believe there would be. The tartness reminded me of the tang from <a title=\"Belgian Sour Ale, brah.\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/belgian-sour-ale-brah\/\">our cherry belgian<\/a>, which comes mostly on the swallow, not in the mouth.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>El Mole Ocho<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1066\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"New Holland El Mole Ocho\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2910.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1066\" title=\"New Holland El Mole Ocho\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2910-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"New Holland El Mole Ocho\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nI've already had (and loved) this beer, so it was the only thing I had that wasn't \"special\" in some way. On the nose, it has a nice malty character, almost no hops with a hint of spiciness. The flavor, however, is full of hot pepper flavor, but honestly more well-balanced with malt than I remember. It's not blistering hot like <a title=\"Pepper Porter v2.0\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/09\/pepper-porter-v2-0\/\">our second pepper porter<\/a>, but reminds you the heat is there, along with the pepper flavor. I really like this beer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Charkoota Rye<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1067\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"New Holland Charkoota Rye\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2915.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1067\" title=\"New Holland Charkoota Rye\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2915-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"New Holland Charkoota Rye\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis tastes a lot like El Mole Ocho with smoke serving as the \"special flavor\" instead of pepper (although they're very different beers in reality). Aroma is a slightly malty but mostly smoky. Taste is super heavy on the smoke up front, but if you let it linger a bit, you get much more maltiness, for a nice balanced beer. A solid Kolsch with delicious smoky flavor. This was a lot like what I was hoping the BOB Brewery BBQ Beer would be at Winter Beer Festival.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Imperial Hatter<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1068\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"New Holland Imperial Hatter\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2918.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1068\" title=\"New Holland Imperial Hatter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2918-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"New Holland Imperial Hatter\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nClassic imperial IPA (can an imperial IPA be \"classic?\"). Nothing really distinct from other beers in the genre. Decent nose\/body balance, some graperuit citrus and a lot of bitterness in the flavor.\r\n<h3>Overall<\/h3>\r\nOf course, if I had read a little more carefully before heading out, I would have seen that many of the beers weren't going to be tapped until later in the night, and I wouldn't have shown up at quarter-to-6... since I closed the place down, that's more than 8 hours in the bar. Oops. Good times were certainly had by all.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"New Holland at Ashleys","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"new-holland-at-ashleys","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-04-15 16:58:59","post_modified_gmt":"2011-04-15 20:58:59","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=1053","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The beer is very clear, and I can still see CO2 bubbles making their way to the top.\n\nAroma: Very strong, slightly caramelly malt notes, maybe a hint of honey as well. Not much hop notes coming through. That could be because I've let this bottle sit for a while.\n\nTaste: The beer doesn't have a strong, initial bitterness. On my first sip, I actually thought the malt might be a bit stronger than I would like. Then I get a lingering bitterness that coats the mouth, and balances out the future sips. The beer is probably quite bitter in IBUs and whatnot, but it turns out to be more balanced than anything.\n\nMouthfeel: I could actually go for a little more carbonation, and a little lower gravity. I know this is an imperial pale, but I think it would be better a bit dryer and crisper.

There were about 10 beers on tap, ranging from the ordinary (Poet Stout, which you can pick up at pretty much any grocery store in the state) to the ordinary-but-on-Firkin (Dragon's Milk), to those I'd never seen before (Charkoota Rye).\n<h3>Night Tripper<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"attachment_1062\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"New Holland Night Tripper\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2904.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1062\" title=\"New Holland Night Tripper\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2904-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"New Holland Night Tripper\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nImperial Stout (10.8% ABV) Tastes really strong, there's plenty of alcohol in the flavor. Really roasty with some chocolate notes. Pretty darn malty sweet (as imperial stouts, especially Russian Impoerial Stouts, often are). I would almost say it could have been fermented a little more to a lower final gravity to dry it out a bit, but it's already bordering on liquorbeer, so upping the alcohol content is unnecessary.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Dragon's Milk Firkin<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"attachment_1063\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"New Holland Dragon&#39;s Milk (Firkin)\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2905.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1063\" title=\"New Holland Dragon's Milk (Firkin)\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2905-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"New Holland Dragon's Milk (Firkin)\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nAs beers served on firkin always are, this was warm, and it was flat as well. After the Night Tripper, it almost tastes bland (though it's one of my favorite beers usually). I think the Firkin really damps a bit of the aroma, partially because there's less carbonation maybe. Hardly get anything on the nose, very light on the vanilla, a nice roasty smell. Tastes a little hot in the back of the mouth, and you definitely get the barrel-aged flavor. Not necessarily bad, but I'm used to (loving) the beer as normally served.\n<h3>Envious<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"attachment_1064\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"New Holland Envious\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2908.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1064\" title=\"New Holland Envious\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2908-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"New Holland Envious\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nNot what I expected. Ingredients listed as pears and raspberries, I was expecting something relatively light in color or even a wheat, but it had a nice deep mahogany (my apartment smells of it) color. A little fruit on the nose - all pear. In the flavor, mostly pear, but I definitely see where the \"slumber on oak\" with raspberries comes in. Not as tart as the description led me to believe there would be. The tartness reminded me of the tang from <a title=\"Belgian Sour Ale, brah.\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/belgian-sour-ale-brah\/\">our cherry belgian<\/a>, which comes mostly on the swallow, not in the mouth.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>El Mole Ocho<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"attachment_1066\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"New Holland El Mole Ocho\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2910.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1066\" title=\"New Holland El Mole Ocho\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2910-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"New Holland El Mole Ocho\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nI've already had (and loved) this beer, so it was the only thing I had that wasn't \"special\" in some way. On the nose, it has a nice malty character, almost no hops with a hint of spiciness. The flavor, however, is full of hot pepper flavor, but honestly more well-balanced with malt than I remember. It's not blistering hot like <a title=\"Pepper Porter v2.0\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/09\/pepper-porter-v2-0\/\">our second pepper porter<\/a>, but reminds you the heat is there, along with the pepper flavor. I really like this beer.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Charkoota Rye<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"attachment_1067\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"New Holland Charkoota Rye\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2915.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1067\" title=\"New Holland Charkoota Rye\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2915-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"New Holland Charkoota Rye\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nThis tastes a lot like El Mole Ocho with smoke serving as the \"special flavor\" instead of pepper (although they're very different beers in reality). Aroma is a slightly malty but mostly smoky. Taste is super heavy on the smoke up front, but if you let it linger a bit, you get much more maltiness, for a nice balanced beer. A solid Kolsch with delicious smoky flavor. This was a lot like what I was hoping the BOB Brewery BBQ Beer would be at Winter Beer Festival.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Imperial Hatter<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"attachment_1068\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"New Holland Imperial Hatter\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2918.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1068\" title=\"New Holland Imperial Hatter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/IMG_2918-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"New Holland Imperial Hatter\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nClassic imperial IPA (can an imperial IPA be \"classic?\"). Nothing really distinct from other beers in the genre. Decent nose\/body balance, some graperuit citrus and a lot of bitterness in the flavor.\n<h3>Overall<\/h3>\nOf course, if I had read a little more carefully before heading out, I would have seen that many of the beers weren't going to be tapped until later in the night, and I wouldn't have shown up at quarter-to-6... since I closed the place down, that's more than 8 hours in the bar. Oops. Good times were certainly had by all.\n\n&nbsp;","post_title":"New Holland at Ashleys","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"1053-autosave","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-04-15 17:00:09","post_modified_gmt":"2011-04-15 21:00:09","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"1053","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/04\/1053-autosave\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Tim, the only one living with brewing equipment, was without a stove, Paul only recently was able to brew, with his friend's setup, and I was dealing with a roommate who was looking for a reason to get me evicted. Eventually I decided my roommate would just have to grow up and realize he didn't get his way all the time (this prompted me recieving an empty threat that I was 'getting an eviction notice tomorrow for brewing beer', a laughable claim, that has yet to even earn me a landlordian repremand).\r\n\r\nSo what kind of setup did I want? What pieces did I need\/want, and what could I do without? Having pieced together our setup in Ann Arbor over more than a year, I knew what was important, what was convienent, and what I could overlook. These were the things I had to get, and my options for them:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Sugar Conversion - Mashtun OR Only be able to use malt extract<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Brew Pot - Large pot + stove OR Turkey fryer<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Cooling System - Copper wort chiller OR Use of sink<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Fermentation Vessel - 6.5 Gal Glass carboy OR Ale Pale<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Carbonation\/Storage - Spigoted Ale Pale\/Bottling OR Kegging kit<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nPart of the fun of brewing is mixing your own grains and mashing them. Only using malt extract is easier, but other than the initial startup cost of a mashtun, the per batch cost of extract is much higher. I went with a 10 gallon rubbermaid mash tun using a modified ( read the instructions and made it up as I went along once I got to the hardware store) version of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewtalk.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Converting_a_cooler_to_a_mash_tun#How_to_make_a_cheap_10_or_5_gallon_MLT_with_a_Rubbermaid_Cooler.\">these<\/a> instructions.\r\n\r\nFor the brew pot, I spent some time shopping around, but I actually was able to find a 7.5 gallon turkey fryer for less than I could find a brewpot of the same size. While this route also took the purchase of propane, it was totally worth it, but more on that later.\r\n\r\nFor cooling, I was able to find a wort chiller for about $45 dollars, but I hadn' scrimpt on anything yet, and with the time savings from the turkey fryer, I figured I'd go cheap here. 45 minutes in time savings isn't worth fifty bucks to me... at least not right away.\r\n\r\nThe final two items I was able to pick up as a package deal, along with other odds and ends I needed (thermometer, hydrometer, etc.) from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewing.org\/\">Adventures in Homebrewing<\/a>. For a little over $200, I was able to get a kegging kit, ale pale, and 5 gallon carboy. The other option was to drop the kegging kit and get a wort chiller, brewpot and a spigoted ale pale, but for 20 bucks more. Given my feelings about kegging (it's awesome and easy) vs. my feeling about bottling (it takes too long, and requires hoarding bottles) I went with the kegging kit.\r\n\r\nNow, all in all, this totalled up to about $350. Sadly, I also needed to get it to where I live. This added a good $200s in shipping costs, because the Vail Valley is apparently more difficult to ship to than Valdez (hyperbole, but not by much).\r\n\r\nIn addition to my order from Adventures in Homebrewing, I had them pack in a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/04\/recipe-vail-ale-batch-1-wee-heavy\/\">Wee Heavy recipe<\/a> and shipped it out. Sadly, the autosyphon that shipped was damaged in transit, but everything else arrived safe and sound in less than a week.I finally got my shtuff together, found a friend to give me a hand and brewed. All went well, aside from a slight snafu involving the airlock seal on the ale pale leading me to think the yeast was dead, leading me to rush to the nearest brewery to beg for some active yeast, only to get home, open the pale, to find a nice layer of krausen on top... Always double check your grommets.\r\n\r\nI have yet to fill up my CO2 tank, to keg the brew, but it is now fully fermented, and I eagerly await getting it all done (I did snag a taste of it from the carboy, as well as a gravity reading: A bit strong, and a little more dry than I was hoping, but should be a fantastic brew).","post_title":"Starting From Scratch: Building a Setup","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"starting-from-scratch-building-a-setup","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-04-26 21:34:22","post_modified_gmt":"2011-04-27 01:34:22","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=1073","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

While this route also took the purchase of propane, it was totally worth it, but more on that later.\n\nFor cooling, I was able to find a wort chiller for about $45 dollars, but I hadn' scrimpt on anything yet, and with the time savings from the turkey fryer, I figured I'd go cheap here. 45 minutes in time savings isn't worth fifty bucks to me... at least not right away.\n\nThe final two items I was able to pick up as a package deal, along with other odds and ends I needed (thermometer, hydrometer, etc.) from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewing.org\/\">Adventures in Homebrewing<\/a>. For a little over $200, I was able to get a kegging kit, ale pale, and 5 gallon carboy. The other option was to drop the kegging kit and get a wort chiller, brewpot and a spigoted ale pale, but for 20 bucks more. Given my feelings about kegging (it's awesome and easy) vs. my feeling about bottling (it takes too long, and requires hoarding bottles) I went with the kegging kit.\n\nNow, all in all, this totalled up to about $350. Sadly, I also needed to get it to where I live. This added a good $200s in shipping costs, because the Vail Valley is apparently more difficult to ship to than Valdez (hyperbole, but not by much).\n\nIn addition to my order from Adventures in Homebrewing, I had them pack in a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/04\/recipe-vail-ale-batch-1-wee-heavy\/\">Wee Heavy recipe<\/a> and shipped it out. Sadly, the autosyphon that shipped was damaged in transit, but everything else arrived safe and sound in less than a week.I finally got my shtuff together, found a friend to give me a hand and brewed. All went well, aside from a slight snafu involving the airlock seal on the ale pale leading me to think the yeast was dead, leading me to rush to the nearest brewery to beg for some active yeast, only to get home, open the pale, to find a nice layer of krausen on top... Always double check your grommets.\n\nI have yet to fill up my CO2 tank, to keg the brew, but it is now fully fermented, and I eagerly await getting it all done (I did snag a taste of it from the carboy.","post_title":"Starting From Scratch: Building a Setup","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"1073-revision","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-04-19 14:46:23","post_modified_gmt":"2011-04-19 18:46:23","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"1073","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/04\/1073-revision\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Of course, at the end of the day, these rankings are ultimately subjective. Some of the things I value in a beer bar are probably different than what someone else values. So, what do I value?\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Selection<\/strong>. For a beer bar, this always has been and always will be the #1 criterion. You can't be a beer bar with only 15 choices. Good selection can manifest itself in different ways, as well (emphasis on local beers, emphasis on international beers, emphasis on a particular style, etc.). However, a wide variety is always important.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Knowledgable Staff<\/strong>. This can be a semi-controversial topic. Some people simply don't care if the staff knows anything, as long as they can get their beer. Some people want the bartender to know every last thing about every beer. I'm somewhere in the middle. As long as the person serving me knows the name and brewery for everything that's available, I'm OK. Knowing the style for everything is good, but not crucial. It's a bonus if they know the location of every brewery.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Atmosphere<\/strong>. Again, there is a range of preferences here, but somewhere has to at least be inviting and \"feel like a beer bar.\" It can be a pub-type, it can feel like a brewery taproom (warehouse-style), but it has to have that intangible feeling of being just right.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Events<\/strong>. It's not necessary to have something every week, but it's really cool when there are beer releases and brewery events held in a beer bar. It brings the beer community together, and makes for a very enjoyable time.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Service<\/strong>. Yes, I'm separating the staff's knowledge from their ability to efficiently serve. One of my favorite beer bars of them all (Ashley's) is notorious for having terrible service, but the selection and knowledge make up for it.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Clientele<\/strong>. This one is a little less crucial. Sure, it's nice to have some other patrons to chat with, but if that's not the case, so be it.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nWhat am I missing? Surely these aren't the most important factors to everyone out there, right?","post_title":"What Makes a Good Beer Bar?","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"what-makes-a-good-beer-bar","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-04-25 11:56:53","post_modified_gmt":"2011-04-25 15:56:53","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=1081","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

The selection of beers is very different from what I was used to in Ann Arbor. It's a big market, which can make it desirable for many brewers, but there's a lot of competition.\n\nThere have been a handful of breweries that have stood to me since I've moved to Chicago. Some of them I just hadn't seen before and others I'd just passed over for no good reason.\n<h3>Lagunitas<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"307\" caption=\"Hop Stoopid during my first brew day in Chicago\"]<img class=\"  \" title=\"Hop Stoopid\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/_yB8ZIqebwqg\/TTO8xUy5kFI\/AAAAAAAAGx4\/nB1VYTo2d80\/s640\/IMG_2597.JPG\" alt=\"Lagunitas Hop Stoopid\" width=\"307\" height=\"230\" \/>[\/caption]\n\nI've been constantly picking six packs and bombers of Lagunitas the past couple of months. After finally picking up a bomber of Hop Stoopid, I was hooked. They fit into my stereotype of West Coast brewers: big, citrusy hops and clean flavors.\n\nLittle Sumpin' Sumpin' ale, a hopped up wheat beer, might become my go to summer beer. It has the \"summery\" notes that I associate with Oberon along with the great orange, grapefruit notes I get from Red's Rye or Two Hearted. The only thing that could keep it from the top spot is the fact that it's 7.2% ABV, which could knock me out a bitch more than I really need.\n\nEvery beer I've had from Lagunitas has been amazing. I'm looking forward to trying some more of their seasonal and limited release beers.\n\nBeers I've had: <em>Hop Stoopid, Little Sumpin' Sumpin', Maximus, Wilco Tango Foxtrot (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ataleoftwobrewers.com\/2011\/04\/we-have-winner-lagunita-wilco-tango.html\">Reviewed in a guest post on A Tale of Two Brewers<\/a>).<\/em>\n<h3>3Floyds<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"attachment_682\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Three Floyds\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1648.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-682\" title=\"Three Floyds\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/IMG_1648-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Three Floyds\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nI had heard of 3Floyds while living in Michigan, but I don't remember ever trying any, and I don't think they distribute to the mitten. They obviously have a reputation that preceded them, and the stories I'd heard from Dark Lord Day seemed pretty epic. Tim stopped there on this <a title=\"ROAD TRIP: Chicago\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2011\/01\/road-trip-chicago\/\">epic road trip to Chicago<\/a>, which made me really jealous.\n\nThere may not be a bar and brewery more spiritually linked than Local Option and 3Floyds. They both really exemplify an independent, rock-and-roll, headstrong spirit, which leads to crazy beers and an awesome (if sometimes quite loud) atmosphere.\n\nThe latest 3Floyds beer I've been raving about is the Zombie Dust. I've had it on draft and from a firkin, and it's an amazingly complex tasting yet simply made beer. It is an American Pale Ale that is hopped exclusively with Citra hops, which the bartender at Local Option described as, \"a glass of orange juice with a big bag of weed.\" Citra hops have an awesome mix of citrus, earthiness and floral notes. It makes for an awesome beer.\n\nSir Robert the Bruce is a top 5 scotch ale, and Gumball Head is right up there with Little Sumpin' Sumpin' in whatever style you slot those beers in. Whenever I see 3Floyds on draft, I'll usually order it, and I the only time I wasn't blown away was with their Baltic Porter.\n\nBeers I've had: <em>Sir Robert the Bruce, Gumball Head, Alpha King, Arctic Panzer Wolf, Baltic Porter, Zombie Dust.<\/em>\n<h3>Two Brothers<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"attachment_1078\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"270\" caption=\"Two Brothers Brewing Co. - Warrenville, IL\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/Two-Brothers-Brewing.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1078 \" title=\"Two-Brothers-Brewing\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/Two-Brothers-Brewing-300x256.jpg\" alt=\"Two Brothers Brewing\" width=\"270\" height=\"230\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nI had never heard of Two Brothers before I picked up a six pack of Cane and Ebel (<a title=\"Beer Review: Two Brothers Cane &amp; Ebel\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/10\/beer-review-two-brothers-cane-ebel\/\">review<\/a>). Since then, I've been picking up six packs regularly as they're very reasonably priced and always very good. Not only does Two Brothers, but they also were instrumental in setting up <a href=\"http:\/\/www.windycitydistribution.com\/\">Windy City Distribution<\/a>, an independent beer distributor that has played a huge role in getting new and interesting beers into Chicago. Drinking a Two Brothers beer is doing double duty for the craft beer movement!\n\nThere isn't a particular beer that stands out, as they have all been really good. Trying Domaine Dupage was a revelation. I normally avoid beers labeled as Farmhouse Ales. For whatever reason, most beers that are termed Farmhouse don't have a compelling flavor profile to me. Domaine Dupage certainly does, though. The most similar, popular beer is probably Fat Tire. It has a really nice, complex malt profile, with just enough hops to keep it from being cloying. It is a very nice, sessionable beer, especially good during the autumn.\n\nBeers I've had: <em>Cane &amp; Ebel, Ebelsweiss, Northwind Imperial Stout, Bitter End Pale Ale, Domaine Dupage, Long Haul Session.<\/em>\n<h3>How About You?<\/h3>\nAre there any new breweries that you have been trying?

Good selection can manifest itself in different ways, as well (emphasis on local beers, emphasis on international beers, emphasis on a particular style, etc.). However, a wide variety is always important.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Knowledgable Staff<\/strong>. This can be a semi-controversial topic. Some people simply don't care if the staff knows anything, as long as they can get their beer. Some people want the bartender to know every last thing about every beer. I'm somewhere in the middle. As long as the person serving me knows the name and brewery for everything that's available, I'm OK. Knowing the style for everything is good, but not crucial. It's a bonus if they know the location of every brewery.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Atmosphere<\/strong>. Again, there is a range of preferences here, but somewhere has to at least be inviting and \"feel like a beer bar.\" It can be a pub-type, it can feel like a brewery taproom (warehouse-style), but it has to have that intangible feeling of being just right.<\/li>\n\t<li>Events. It's not necessary<\/li>\n\t<li>Accessibility<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Service<\/strong>. Yes, I'm separating the staff's knowledge from their ability to efficiently serve. One of my favorite beer bars of them all (Ashley's) is notorious for having terrible service, but the selection and knowledge make up for it.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Clientele<\/strong>. This one is a little less crucial. Sure, it's nice to have some other patrons to chat with, but if that's not the case, so be it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\nWhat am I missing?

Eventually I decided my roommate would just have to grow up and realize he didn't get his way all the time (this prompted me recieving an empty threat that I was 'getting an eviction notice tomorrow for brewing beer', a laughable claim, that has yet to even earn me a landlordian repremand).\n\nSo what kind of setup did I want? What pieces did I need\/want, and what could I do without?

I'm searching for that resinous, piney flavor, but it's just not there. The taste is almost all malts and yeast.\n\nMouthfeel: The carbonation could actually be a bit higher. The beer is a bit cloying as it is. The extra bubbles could help brighten it up a little. Overall, it's a bit heavy and sweet.\n\nOverall: I was honestly hoping for more aromatics from the pine.

A big change, not only replacing the 10,000 foot tall mountains with 1,000 foot tall skyscrapers, but being around more than the same 3 dingy bars with nothing but Coors Light and Miller Highlife on tap. Now I live in a city with hundreds of bars, dozens of breweries, and ale houses with beer lists so long, reading it makes Tolstoy seem brief, though they both feature just as many Russian Imperials - wordplay!

One week in May, I was working remotely, Tim's significant was out of town studying and Tim could take a day off to work from home. So a brew day was born.\n\nWe met up in Ann Arbor at Ashley's after I drove in from Chicago. After we left the bar, we decided to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/homebrewing.org\">Adventures in Homebrewing's<\/a> new Ann Arbor location. I had a recipe for a Belgian Strong Golden Ale that I put together a little bit ago that we put together. Then we decided, why not make two beers? So we did a sort of off the cuff Black IPA<sup>1<\/sup>.\n\nIt was fun exploring the new store and putting together an ingredients kit just like the old days. It actually turned out to be a pretty solid recipe despite the fact we were going on feel more than math.\n<h3>Mash<\/h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>6 lbs American 2-row<\/li>\n\t<li>1.5 lbs Victory<\/li>\n\t<li>1 lb Flaked Rice<\/li>\n\t<li>0.5 lbs <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brewingwithbriess.com\/Assets\/PDFs\/Briess_PISB_BlackprinzMalt.pdf\">Blackprinz<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\nSingle step mash at 150ºF for 60 minutes.

{"ID":"1222","post_author":"2","post_date":"2012-07-23 14:15:04","post_date_gmt":"2012-07-23 18:15:04","post_content":"Stone has a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stonebrew.com\/collab\/default.asp\">long history of collaborations<\/a>. Not all of them are hits, but I can usually find them at my local bottle shop for about $3 for a 12oz bottle. As unit price, it's a little high, but it's a low enough price point that I don't mind dropping it on something that could be a crap shoot. And, with some of these somewhat out there beers, you may not want much more than a 12 ounces.\r\n\r\nI've been on a saison kick for a little over a year, since I tasted my first batch of Rye Saison. We recently brewed a second batch, and since we certainly can't keep well enough alone, we decided to split off a bit and do something different. Naturally, I'm always looking for inspiration, and this really seems to fit the bill.\r\n\r\nHere's Sam Caglione of Dogfish Head tasting the beer in a Reno 911 costume (… I don't know):\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/i4R2OIb5C9Q\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"584\" height=\"329\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nYeah… so there's that. Anyway, these are three great brewers getting together to do something right in my wheelhouse. Even if it was more expensive, I would have probably still would have picked it up.\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/tumblr_m6kbyehRSI1rzr3i9o1_500.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1223\" title=\"Saison du BUFF\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/tumblr_m6kbyehRSI1rzr3i9o1_500.jpeg\" alt=\"Saison du BUFF\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Appearance: <\/strong>The beer is the color of golden straw. It's very transparent with a steady stream of bubbles rising from the stem of the goblet. There's a very minimal white head that quickly reduces to a small patchwork on covering about two thirds of the beer.\r\n\r\n<strong>Aroma<\/strong>: The nose is led by very earthy, grassy notes from the hops. There is also an herbaceous quality that comes across a little savory and a little spicy. Very interesting aroma.\r\n\r\n<strong>Taste<\/strong>: Very, very dry. The beer is crisp, clean and dry like a good saison should be. The first taste is the grassy notes from the hops. What follows is a progression from the different herb flavors.There's a lingering spiciness from the herbs (maybe the thyme?) that leaves the palate fresh.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mouthfeel<\/strong>: The beer is light and dry with very bright carbonation. Right to style for a saison. A little more head might be nice, but that's picking nits.\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall<\/strong>: A lot of beers that are conceived from a joke or reference sacrifice the quality of the overall beer in order to make the more clever joke. This beer manages to pull off the parsly, sage, rosemary and thyme theme by choosing a beer that would be enhanced by the herbs. This is a good beer. The collaboration, theme and whatnot add to the story and help to elevate the beer.

{"ID":"1162","post_author":"2","post_date":"2012-06-29 08:00:33","post_date_gmt":"2012-06-29 12:00:33","post_content":"A little bit ago, Nate and I attended the <a href=\"http:\/\/bkbeerfest.com\/\">Brooklyn Waterfront Beer Festival<\/a>. Nate had moved to Manhattan about a month ago, and I had never been. He found out about the festival somehow, and I found a reasonable flight. We bought our tickets and, in no time at all, a plan was hatched.\r\n\r\nThere was an afternoon session and an evening session available (each 2.5 hours long). We opted for later session to give us more time during the day to do the standard touristy stuff, and ending at 9:30p, the later session transitioned nicely into Bar O'Clock. This festival had some pros and cons, so lets start off on the happy notes.\r\n<h3>What they did right<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1164\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"584\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/IMG_0334.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1164\" title=\"IMG_0334\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/IMG_0334-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"View from the festival\" width=\"584\" height=\"438\" \/><\/a> Looking out onto Manhattan[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe location of the festival was amazing. It was where 11th Ave ended into the river in Brooklyn and it featured some great views of the sun setting behind Manhattan. Also, the neighborhood around the festival had tons of cool bars. Most notably, Brooklyn Brewery was about 2 blocks away. We didn't make it there, but it looked like plenty of people decided to stop by.\r\n\r\nLike I said earlier, the timing of the festival was really nice. It ended early enough that we weren't too exhausted to head out for a few drinks afterward. Initially, we were a little worried that it was only 2.5 hours, but that proved to be more than enough time for us. The crowd and lines really weren't bad at all. We were able to get to the beer we wanted very quickly.\r\n\r\nThey did actually have a lot of good beer there. There were a lot of breweries from the Northeast and mid-Atlantic that I never see in Chicago. They also had some places I really didn't expect to see, including a meadery from Colorado that had a delicious, dry hopped mead. Unfortunately, a lot of the beer notes are going in the next section…\r\n<h3>What Went Wrong<\/h3>\r\nFirst, and very quickly, when you're hosting an event with well over 500 people and the equivalent of an open bar, you need more than 2 port-a-johns. It was gross. I don't really know how the women there were physically able to use the facilities.\r\n\r\nLet's go back to the beer. There were a few local breweries that had their taps manned by people from their brewery. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.508nyc.com\/menu\/beer\">508 Restaurant and Bar <\/a>had their brewer there to answer questions, and providing a nice Black IPA and Saison. Most tables, however, were put together by distributors, with the tenders knowing either the rehearsed sales pitch for the brewery or even less.\r\n\r\nI was excited to see some of the bigger, more national craft brewers there as well. Lagunitas, Sierra Nevada, Ommegang, Allagash and Goose Island all had tables, but the beers that were being poured were al the standards. Maybe I've been spoiled by Michigan Brewers Guild festivals, but the beer choices all seemed uninspired. I think this is largely due to the event being put on by an events company working with distributors, rather than brewers working together with an event company coordinating. Beyond that, I really don't think Blue Moon and Negro Modelo belong at a craft beer festival, but that could just be snobbery.\r\n\r\nFinally, since the beers were being put together by the distributors, you'd think they could put together a list that had some variety instead of half of the booths having at least one Black IPA, IPA, DIPA or IIPA. There were very few malty beers, very few belgian style beers, and virtually no contrast.\r\n<h3>The Best Beers There<\/h3>\r\nLike I said, I enjoyed the two beers from 508. <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/2210\/50697\">Firestone Walker Double Jack<\/a> is always a winner in my book even among a sea of hop heavy beers. The dry hopped mead was delicious as well. The best beer we had though, was the <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/10272\/39258\">Innis and Gunn Rum Cask Oak Aged Beer<\/a>. I think it won out for two main reasons. First, it was a contrast from all the hop heavy beers at the festival. It was malty, sweet (but not cloying) and delicious. Secondly, it was a flavor profile I hadn't had before. I've had <a title=\"Oak’d Wee Heavy Recipe\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/oakd-wee-heavy-recipe\/\">scotch ales<\/a> before, and I've had <a href=\"http:\/\/newhollandbrew.com\/beer\/pub-brews\/rum-barrel-aged-pilgrims-dole\/\">beers aged in rum barrels<\/a> before, but the combination was something new and exciting.

It was where 11th Ave ended into the river in Brooklyn and it featured some great views of the sun setting behind Manhattan. Also, the neighborhood around the festival had tons of cool bars. Most notably, Brooklyn Brewery was about 2 blocks away. We didn't make it there, but it looked like plenty of people decided to stop by.\r\n\r\nLike I said earlier, the timing of the festival was really nice. It ended early enough that we weren't too exhausted to head out for a few drinks afterward. Initially, we were a little worried that it was only 2.5 hours, but that proved to be more then enough time for us. The crowd and lines really weren't bad at all. We were able to get to the beer we wanted very quickly.\r\n\r\nThey did actually have a lot of good beer there. There were a lot of breweries from the Northeast and mid-Atlantic that I never see in Chicago. They also had some places I really didn't expect to see, including a meadery from Colorado that had a delicious, dry hopped mead. Unfortunately, a lot of the beer notes are going in the next section…\r\n<h3>What Went Wrong<\/h3>\r\nFirst, and very quickly, when you're hosting an event with well over 500 people and the equivalent of an open bar, you need more than 2 port-a-johns. It was gross. I don't really know how the women there were physically able to use the facilities.\r\n\r\nLet's go back to the beer. There were a few local breweries that had their taps manned by people from their brewery. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.508nyc.com\/menu\/beer\">508 Restaurant and Bar <\/a>had their brewer there to answer questions, and providing a nice Black IPA and Saison. Most tables, however, were put together by distributors, with the tenders knowing either the rehearsed sales pitch for the brewery or even less.\r\n\r\nI was excited to see some of the bigger, more national craft brewers there as well. Lagunitas, Sierra Nevada, Ommegang, Allagash and Goose Island all had tables, but the beers that were being poured were al the standards. Maybe I've been spoiled by Michigan Brewers Guild festivals, but the beer choices all seemed uninspired. I think this is largely due to the event being put on by an events company working with distributors, rather than brewers working together with an event company coordinating. Beyond that, I really don't think Blue Moon and Negro Modelo belong at a craft beer festival, but that could just be snobbery.\r\n\r\nFinally, since the beers were being put together by the distributors, you'd think they could put together a list that had some variety instead of half of the booths having at least one Black IPA, IPA, DIPA or IIPA. There were very few malty beers, very few belgian style beers, and virtually no contrast.\r\n<h3>The Best Beers There<\/h3>\r\nLike I said, I enjoyed the two beers from 508. Firestone Walker Double Jack is always a winner in my book even among a sea of hop heavy beers. The dry hopped mead was delicious as well. The best beer we had though, was the <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/10272\/39258\">Innis and Gunn Rum Cask Oak Aged Beer<\/a>. I think it won out for two main reasons. First, it was a contrast from all the hop heavy beers at the festival. It was malty, sweet (but not cloying) and delicious. Secondly, it was a flavor profile I hadn't had before. I've had <a title=\"Oak’d Wee Heavy Recipe\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/oakd-wee-heavy-recipe\/\">scotch ales<\/a> before, and I've had <a href=\"http:\/\/newhollandbrew.com\/beer\/pub-brews\/rum-barrel-aged-pilgrims-dole\/\">beers aged in rum barrels<\/a> before, but the combination was something new and exciting.

This festival had some pros and cons, so lets start off on the happy notes.\r\n<h3>What they did right<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1164\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"584\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/IMG_0334.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1164\" title=\"IMG_0334\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/IMG_0334-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"View from the festival\" width=\"584\" height=\"438\" \/><\/a> Looking out onto Manhattan[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe location of the festival was amazing. It was where 11th Ave ended into the river in Brooklyn and it featured some great views of the sun setting behind Manhattan. Also, the neighborhood around the festival had tons of cool bars. Most notably, Brooklyn Brewery was about 2 blocks away. We didn't make it there, but it looked like plenty of people decided to stop by.\r\n\r\nLike I said earlier, the timing of the festival was really nice. It ended early enough that we weren't too exhausted to head out for a few drinks afterward. Initially, we were a little worried that it was only 2.5 hours, but that proved to be more then enough time for us. The crowd and lines really weren't bad at all. We were able to get to the beer we wanted very quickly.\r\n\r\nThey did actually have a lot of good beer there. There were a lot of breweries from the Northeast and mid-Atlantic that I never see in Chicago. They also had some places I really didn't expect to see, including a meadery from Colorado that had a delicious, dry hopped mead. Unfortunately, a lot of the beer notes are going in the next section…\r\n<h3>What Went Wrong<\/h3>\r\nFirst, and very quickly, when you're hosting an event with well over 500 people and the equivalent of an open bar, you need more than 2 port-a-johns. It was gross. I don't really know how the women there were physically able to use the facilities.\r\n\r\nLet's go back to the beer. There were a few local breweries that had their taps manned by people from their brewery. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.508nyc.com\/menu\/beer\">508 Restaurant and Bar <\/a>had their brewer there to answer questions, and providing a nice Black IPA and Saison. Most tables, however, were put together by distributors, with the tenders knowing either the rehearsed sales pitch for the brewery or even less.\r\n\r\nI was excited to see some of the bigger, more national craft brewers there as well. Lagunitas, Sierra Nevada, Ommegang, Allagash and Goose Island all had tables, but the beers that were being poured were al the standards. Maybe I've been spoiled by Michigan Brewers Guild festivals, but the beer choices all seemed uninspired. I think this is largely due to the event being put on by an events company working with distributors, rather than brewers working together with an event company coordinating. Beyond that, I really don't think Blue Moon and Negro Modelo belong at a craft beer festival, but that could just be snobbery.\r\n\r\nFinally, since the beers were being put together by the distributors, you'd think they could put together a list that had some variety instead of half of the booths having at least one Black IPA, IPA, DIPA or IIPA. There were very few malty beers, very few belgian style beers, and virtually no contrast.\r\n<h3>The Best Beers There<\/h3>\r\nLike I said, I enjoyed the two beers from 508. <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/2210\/50697\">Firestone Walker Double Jack<\/a> is always a winner in my book even among a sea of hop heavy beers. The dry hopped mead was delicious as well. The best beer we had though, was the <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/10272\/39258\">Innis and Gunn Rum Cask Oak Aged Beer<\/a>. I think it won out for two main reasons. First, it was a contrast from all the hop heavy beers at the festival. It was malty, sweet (but not cloying) and delicious. Secondly, it was a flavor profile I hadn't had before. I've had <a title=\"Oak’d Wee Heavy Recipe\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/oakd-wee-heavy-recipe\/\">scotch ales<\/a> before, and I've had <a href=\"http:\/\/newhollandbrew.com\/beer\/pub-brews\/rum-barrel-aged-pilgrims-dole\/\">beers aged in rum barrels<\/a> before, but the combination was something new and exciting. Those moments of discovery is why I enjoy going to beer festivals and tastings and events. Those are the moments that event coordinators should try to create.","post_title":"Brooklyn Waterfront Beer Festival","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"1162-revision-7","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2012-06-25 15:03:35","post_modified_gmt":"2012-06-25 19:03:35","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"1162","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/06\/1162-revision-7\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

There were posts trying to figure out what to call this new style. Is it a Black IPA? A Robust Porter? Cascadian Dark Ale? The industry seems to have settled on Black IPA, and they've started becoming fairly commonplace.\r\n\r\nI remember the first BIPA I tried. I was at my go to bar, with my go to server (who has since changed jobs) looking down the draft list. I asked him if there was anything exciting, and he just nodded and started pouring me <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/147\/38470\">Stone Sublimely Self Righteous Ale<\/a>. I'm not sure if that was the first major BIPA, but I know it certainly was a lot of people's first BIPA. There are moments quaffing beer that are special, when you try something that you haven't tasted before. That was one of those moments.\r\n\r\nI continued to keep a look out for BIPAs and picked them up at bottle shops or ordered them at the bar when I found them. But after a while, more and more started showing up. Some of them still blow me away, but the hit rate seems to have gone down, and I tend to look for other styles.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1176\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/over.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1176\" title=\"over\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/over-300x161.png\" alt=\"Fred Armisen from Portlandia\" width=\"300\" height=\"161\" \/><\/a> BIPAS ARE OVER![\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis is where I push up my hipster glasses and tell you how much better it was before Black IPAs were mainstream. I do worry that I'm becoming a beer snob who will turn up his nose at a perfectly good pint. Well, I decided to give it another go, and picked up a bomber of <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/22951\/55019\">Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet Black IPA<\/a>. The brewer describes it:\r\n<blockquote>Hoppy Feet has been lovingly crafted by combining Premium malt with lots of Amarillo and Columbus Hops.  Grapefruit and Pine are balanced on the nose and on the palate by a nutty, dark chocolate, roasted backbone.<\/blockquote>\r\nThis has been knocking around in my \"cellar<sup><a id=\"1_text\" href=\"#1\">1<\/a><\/sup>\" for a while. I generally try to drink hoppy beers fresh. I think you get more of what the brewer is trying to produce that way. This may not be a completely fair shake, so I might try it from a tap if I see it around to compare.\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1172\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/tumblr_m67f9avhWz1rzr3i9o1_500.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1172\" title=\"tumblr_m67f9avhWz1rzr3i9o1_500\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/tumblr_m67f9avhWz1rzr3i9o1_500.jpg\" alt=\"Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a> Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet Black IPA[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>Appearance<\/strong>: The beer pours a very, dark copper, with very little translucence. Holding up it the light, you get some flashes of ruby. There was a one finger, creamy head that receded quickly down to about half a finger and remained there.\r\n\r\n<strong>Aroma<\/strong>: The aroma is a mix of a spicy hops with a strong caramel note from the malt base. The nose is incredibly well balanced.\r\n\r\n<strong>Taste<\/strong>: Unfortunately, the taste isn't as well balanced as the nose. The first flavor is a muted malt taste, that is immediately followed by an intense bitterness that mixes with alcohol heat and some acridity from the dark malts. The after taste is a lingering, coating bitterness that stays on my tongue.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mouthfeel<\/strong>: The beer is very smooth with a slightly heavy body for an IPA. There's a bit of carbonation from the bomber, but nothing too effervescent.\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall<\/strong>: Maybe I've just been in a <a href=\"http:\/\/yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/07\/recipe-impromptu-black-ipa\/ ‎\">BIPA<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/06\/brooklyn-waterfront-beer-festival\">overload<\/a>, but this beer doesn't really do much for me. The bitterness overpowers the malt flavors that I want, yet manages to accentuate the acridity that I would want to hide. Also, while I enjoy hoppy beers, I don't care for the lingering and sometimes muddy bitterness in a lot of IPAs. The best hop bombs, Firestone Walker Double Jack and Bell's Hopslam (short list, and strictly my opinion), have a great hop nose with a deceptively strong malt backbone to stand up to the hops. The bitterness also is cleaner, with more flavor, be it citrus, spice, earthiness, grassiness, rather than just unplaceable bitterness.\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>My \"cellar\" is a couple of cupboards above my microwave. <a href=\"#1_text\">↩<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>","post_title":"Review: Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"review-clown-shoes-hoppy-feet","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2012-07-16 09:40:39","post_modified_gmt":"2012-07-16 13:40:39","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=1171","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Holding up it the light, you get some flashes of ruby. There was a one finger, creamy head that receded quickly down to about half a finger and remained there.\r\n\r\n<strong>Aroma<\/strong>: The aroma is a mix of a spicy hops with a strong caramel note from the malt base. The nose is incredibly well balanced.\r\n\r\n<strong>Taste<\/strong>: Unfortunately, the taste isn't as well balanced as the nose. The first flavor is a muted malt taste, that is immediately followed by an intense bitterness that mixes with alcohol heat and some acridity from the dark malts. The after taste is a lingering, coating bitterness that stays on my tongue.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mouthfeel<\/strong>: The beer is very smooth with a slightly heavy body for an IPA.

It was a Friday night. At my previous job, we got out at noon on Fridays, and that particular day I had to go down to the DMV in the Loop. Since it was also Chicago Craft Beer Week, I figured, why not bar crawl my way back up to my place? I don't get down to that area all that often, and there were some places I was interested in going.\r\n\r\nI IMed Tim throughout the day, and finally sent him a custom Google Map of my route. This proved helpful, since on my bar crawl, I happened to be <em>overserved. <\/em>Couple that with my phone dying, and Nate got into to town and had no where to go. He called Tim, who used the map to play detective and called up the places I had been earlier that. Unfortunately, that didn't help too much that much, since I was passed out on my couch.\r\n\r\nEventually (around 1a) I woke up, called Nate, and brought him up to my apartment, apologizing profusely along the way. We stayed up for a while, drank a bottle of Rodenbach Grand Cru, and eventually passed out around 6a.\r\n\r\nWhat does this delightful story have to do with the beer in question? Well, at some point on my impromptu bar crawl, I ended up stopping at a bottle shot and picking up a mixed six pack, including Three Philosophers. I had seen it at Binny's a few times, and been tempted, but I didn't want to pull the trigger on a $12 bomber. This option was a 12oz bottle, presumably for less (my inhibitions were limited at that point anyway).\r\n\r\nI've been meaning to drink it for a while, but haven't for one reason or another. It's actually a 2010 vintage, which means it's been aging for at least 18 months. This makes it the longest cellaring project I've ever done. Maybe it comes with maturity. I have a couple bottles of Russian River along with a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ratebeer.com\/beer\/two-brothers-hoodwink\/156867\/\" target=\"_blank\">Two Brothers Hoodwink<\/a> that I'm sitting for a while. Anyway, on to the review…\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/tumblr_m6azxp1OTb1rzr3i9o1_500.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1205 aligncenter\" title=\"tumblr_m6azxp1OTb1rzr3i9o1_500\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/tumblr_m6azxp1OTb1rzr3i9o1_500.jpeg\" alt=\"Ommegang Three Philosophers\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<strong>Appearance:<\/strong> The beer pours smooth and viscous. It's coppery with hints of ruby where the light strikes it. It had a two finger, thick, khaki head that gracefully laced down to a thin layer on top.\r\n\r\n<strong>Aroma:<\/strong> The aroma is heavy with tart cherry with a sweet malty backbone. There's a background suggestion of the alcohol heat as well.\r\n\r\n<strong>Taste:<\/strong> The cherrie's aren't as heavy in the taste. Instead there is a raisin\/prune flavor from the malt (Special B? Dark Crystal?). The malt really shines throughout the taste of this beer, and helps tamp down the alcohol heat. That heat is felt, rather than tasted, which is always welcome. The finish is where the cherries come in. For a rich beer, it finish with a very clean, slightly tart flavor from the cherries. Very nice. I'm letting it warm as I drink it. I'm hoping some more flavors may appear.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mouthfeel:<\/strong> This beer is silky smooth and has some weight to it. Definitely one to sip slowly and enjoy.\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall:<\/strong> I'm not sure it's necessary for me to say this is a good beer. That seems to be an <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/42\/3457\/\" target=\"_blank\">established<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ratebeer.com\/beer\/ommegang-three-philosophers\/13667\/\" target=\"_blank\">fact<\/a>. I had never had this beer before tonight, despite having the bottle for over a year, and first resolving to try it over two years ago. All in all, it was worth the wait.

Nate had moved to Manhattan about a month ago, and I had never been. He found out about the festival somehow, and I found a reasonable flight. We bought our tickets and, in no time at all, a plan was hatched.\r\n\r\nThere was an afternoon session and an evening session available (each 2.5 hours long). We opted for later session to give us more time during the day to do the standard touristy stuff, and ending at 9:30p, the later session transitioned nicely into Bar O'Clock. This festival had some pros and cons, so lets start off on the happy notes.\r\n<h3>What they did right<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1164\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"584\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/IMG_0334.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1164\" title=\"IMG_0334\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/IMG_0334-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"View from the festival\" width=\"584\" height=\"438\" \/><\/a> Looking out onto Manhattan[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe location of the festival was amazing. It was where 11th Ave ended into the river in Brooklyn and it featured some great views of the sun setting behind Manhattan. Also, the neighborhood around the festival had tons of cool bars. Most notably, Brooklyn Brewery was about 2 blocks away. We didn't make it there, but it looked like plenty of people decided to stop by.\r\n\r\nLike I said earlier, the timing of the festival was really nice. It ended early enough that we weren't too exhausted to head out for a few drinks afterward. Initially, we were a little worried that it was only 2.5 hours, but that proved to be more then enough time for us. The crowd and lines really weren't bad at all. We were able to get to the beer we wanted very quickly.\r\n\r\nThey did actually have a lot of good beer there. There were a lot of breweries from the Northeast and mid-Atlantic that I never see in Chicago. They also had some places I really didn't expect to see, including a meadery from Colorado that had a delicious, dry hopped mead. Unfortunately, a lot of the beer notes are going in the next section…\r\n<h3>What Went Wrong<\/h3>\r\nFirst, and very quickly, when you're hosting an event with well over 500 people and the equivalent of an open bar, you need more than 2 port-a-johns. It was gross. I don't really know how the women there were physically able to use the facilities.\r\n\r\nLet's go back to the beer. There were a few local breweries that had their taps manned by people from their brewery. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.508nyc.com\/menu\/beer\">508 Restaurant and Bar <\/a>had their brewer there to answer questions, and providing a nice Black IPA and Saison. Most tables, however, were put together by distributors, with the tenders knowing either the rehearsed sales pitch for the brewery or even less.\r\n\r\nI was excited to see some of the bigger, more national craft brewers there as well. Lagunitas, Sierra Nevada, Ommegang, Allagash and Goose Island all had tables, but the beers that were being poured were al the standards. Maybe I've been spoiled by Michigan Brewers Guild festivals, but the beer choices all seemed uninspired. I think this is largely due to the event being put on by an events company working with distributors, rather than brewers working together with an event company coordinating. Beyond that, I really don't think Blue Moon and Negro Modelo belong at a craft beer festival, but that could just be snobbery.\r\n\r\nFinally, since the beers were being put together by the distributors, you'd think they could put together a list that had some variety instead of half of the booths having at least one Black IPA, IPA, DIPA or IIPA. There were very few malty beers, very few belgian style beers, and virtually no contrast.\r\n<h3>The Best Beers There<\/h3>\r\nLike I said, I enjoyed the two beers from 508. <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/2210\/50697\">Firestone Walker Double Jack<\/a> is always a winner in my book even among a sea of hop heavy beers. The dry hopped mead was delicious as well. The best beer we had though, was the <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/10272\/39258\">Innis and Gunn Rum Cask Oak Aged Beer<\/a>. I think it won out for two main reasons. First, it was a contrast from all the hop heavy beers at the festival. It was malty, sweet (but not cloying) and delicious. Secondly, it was a flavor profile I hadn't had before. I've had <a title=\"Oak’d Wee Heavy Recipe\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/08\/oakd-wee-heavy-recipe\/\">scotch ales<\/a> before, and I've had <a href=\"http:\/\/newhollandbrew.com\/beer\/pub-brews\/rum-barrel-aged-pilgrims-dole\/\">beers aged in rum barrels<\/a> before, but the combination was something new and exciting. Those moments of discovery is why I enjoy going to beer festivals and tastings and events. Those are the moments that event coordinators should try to create.","post_title":"Brooklyn Waterfront Beer Festival","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"1162-revision-8","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2012-06-25 15:03:41","post_modified_gmt":"2012-06-25 19:03:41","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"1162","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/06\/1162-revision-8\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

They're big, loud, different and fun. There's that period of apprehension when you're not sure if maybe you added too many habeñeros, or the oil from the peanut butter will make your beer feel slick, or the cocoa powder will make the beer chalky. So far we've been fortunate enough to always make at the very least quaffable beer. Most of the time, it's beer we've really enjoyed drinking.\r\n\r\nThis was how I started out. I was making beers that I'd never seen before (although certainly many have made similar beers before I did). Then, last summer I made a <a title=\"Recipe: Rye Saison\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/07\/recipe-rye-saison\/\">Rye Saison<\/a> that was largely a classic saison with just a small twist. The malt spiciness from the added rye worked to enhance the pepperiness from the yeast (Wyeast 3711). It wasn't some crazy, out there beer. It was a classic, almost to style beer with a small twist that served to enhance what would expect from the beer.\r\n\r\nWhat I've realized is that this is often times much more difficult than doing something crazy. It requires a deep knowledge of the ingredients, their flavor profiles and how these flavors work in concert and affect one another. I think this is the challenge taken on by the brewers in the TBA Brown Ale.\r\n\r\nTBA is a brown ale brewed with brown sugar and molasses, two flavors that really serve to enhance the malty backbone of a good brown ale. In the description, written by Bear Republic's Richard Norgrove Jr., it states:\r\n<blockquote>The unifying goal was to create a new variation on an old style. Brown ales are often misunderstood, hard to brew, and even harder name<\/blockquote>\r\nIt's a worthy goal. Brown ales are often overlooked by beer enthusiasts. They often lie far from any extremes. I think even their status as a great entry to the world of craft beer may be held against them. It's good to see brewers often known for their hop heavy beers take a crack at elevating a subtle, middle of the road ale.\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1248\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/tumblr_m7aeonwyNM1rzr3i9o1_500.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1248\" title=\"Bear Republic \/ Fat Head's \/ Stone TBA Brown Ale\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/tumblr_m7aeonwyNM1rzr3i9o1_500.jpeg\" alt=\"Bear Republic \/ Fat Head's \/ Stone TBA Brown Ale\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a> Bear Republic \/ Fat Head's \/ Stone TBA Brown Ale[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>Appearance<\/strong>: The head formed so quickly as I poured this beer that I almost made a mess. Once it settled down, the beer was a cloudy rust color with a two finger tan head that is still receding down the glass.\r\n\r\n<strong>Aroma<\/strong>: The beer has a strong hop note in the nose. It isn't overwhelming, and it's completely balanced by the sweetness in the malt and molasses. A nicely balanced aroma.\r\n\r\n<strong>Taste<\/strong>: A beer brewed with brown sugar and molasses has a good chance of being too sweet, but this beer is nice and dry. There's the flavor from the dark sugars, but not much residual sweetness. The hops keep it dry without trending toward black IPA.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mouthfeel<\/strong>: There's a lively carbonation that keeps this beer bright and lively. It feels a bit sharp, but not necessarily in a bad way.\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall<\/strong>: Unlike some of the other Stone Collaborations, this one seemed to be less adventuresome. Maybe it's difficult to make a crazy brown ale, but that doesn't mean this isn't a good beer. They made something tasty, if not incredibly interesting.","post_title":"Review: Stone\/Bear Republic\/Fat Head's TBA","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"review-stonebear-republicfat-heads-tba","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2012-07-27 09:16:48","post_modified_gmt":"2012-07-27 13:16:48","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=1247","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

It was getting to be warm out, and we wanted a good summer beer after making some <a title=\"Recipe: Joe Paterno is Olde Ale\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2009\/12\/recipe-joe-paterno-is-olde-ale\/\">heavier fare<\/a>. We were tossing around different styles, and eventually settled on a Saison.\r\n\r\nA  classic Saison is very simple: pils malt, sugar, light hops, and the yeast. The most important ingredient by far is the yeast. We used <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wyeastlab.com\/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=199\">Wyeast 3711<\/a>, and I would recommend holding off on brewing this until you can get your hands on that yeast. It is a workhorse that has great attenuation and provides great flavor when fermented in the mid 70s. Some people may balk at using sugar instead of all malt in a beer, but this is the method used by Trappist and other abbey brewers in Belgium to get beers with higher alcohol but still a light, \"digestible\" body.\r\n\r\nWhen we brewed it last year, it was the first time we had a chance to use our wort chiller. I don't want to sound like I'm exaggerating, but the combination of doing a full all-grain, full boil and crash cooling it made this the best to style beer I've ever made. It ended up with just a little cloudiness from the yeast, light, crisp with great yeast aromas and tastes.\r\n<h3>Mash<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>8.68lbs Belgian Pils<\/li>\r\n\t<li>3.12lbs Rye Malt<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWe did a single step mash at about 155º F for 60 minutes with about 1.25qt of water for every pound of grain. We fly sparged to get up 6.25 gallons for the boil.\r\n<h3>Boil<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>2oz Styrian Goldings (5.4% AA) at 60 minutes<\/li>\r\n\t<li>1lb dark candi sugar<a href=\"#note1\"><sup>1<\/sup><\/a> at 15 minutes<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Fermentation<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Wyeast 3711 French Saison Yeast<\/li>\r\n\t<li>3 weeks in primary in a basement during the summer, so around 72-75 F<\/li>\r\n\t<li>5 weeks in secondary at the same rough temp<\/li>\r\n\t<li>2 weeks of bottle conditioning<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Notes<\/h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><a id=\"note1\">The<\/a> first time we used the standard dark rock sugar that you find at most homebrew shops.

{"ID":"1264","post_author":"2","post_date":"2012-07-19 19:26:26","post_date_gmt":"2012-07-19 23:26:26","post_content":"Though it hasn't made as many <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/tag\/shorts-brew\/\">appearances on these pages<\/a> as I would expect, it's fair to say that all three contributors to  this site are big fans of Short's Brewing. Their beers can be hit-or-miss, sure, but the main thing is this: <em>they're trying crazy shit<\/em>. We're big fans of experimentation in brewing, and there aren't many widely-distributed breweries that are willing to do things like make a bloody mary-themed beer, complete with salty flavor, etc.\n\nSo, I've said all this to preface an admission: despite our love for Short's, and numerous experiences drinking their products, none of us has ever made the trip to Northern Michigan to experience Short's in the flesh.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThanks to a wedding in Traverse City, I found myself in the wild North of Michigan, and - as the plus-one of a member of the bridal party - an entire day with nothing to do. It is common sense what Short's is, but I continued to journey on.\n<h3>Location<\/h3>\nI knew Bellaire was in the middle of nowhere, but man, Bellaire is in the middle of <em>nowhere<\/em>. From Traverse City, there are primary routes to take: along the Grand Traverse Bay, or around the other side of Torch and Elk Lakes to the East.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1257\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/photo.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1257\" title=\"Short's Brewing Company factory\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/photo-e1342627166229-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Short's Brewing Company factory\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> Short's production facility. \"Glory\" is a term used loosely in this instance. Sweet rearview, bro.[\/caption]\n\nSince the Short's production facility is actually in Elk Rapids, about 30 miles from Bellaire, I took the Western route on the way up, and swung by the factory to experience its glory. It was not thrilling, and certainly not while I was just swinging by as I hustled to make it to the brewpub itself.\n\nElk Rapids is no metropolis itself, but is actually in a pretty cool location, on the channel between Elk Lake and the Grand Traverse Bay. As I said, I didn't head into the town itself too much.\n\nAs for the brewpub itself, I've already mentioned that it's... remote... and that's the case. The town of Bellaire consisted entirely of a couple blocks, and the brewery is on the Western edge of that town.\n<h3>Setting and Atmosphere<\/h3>\nBellaire is a quintessential resort town (but with no real reason to visit, other than the variety of lakes a short distance away, I guess), and Short's is one of the few things that seems like it would bring people into the town. From the outside, it's an unassuming building as part of a city block.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1259\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/photo-1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1259\" title=\"Short's Brewing Company Brewpub\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/photo-1-e1342627587308-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Short's Brewing Company Brewpub\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> The calm before the storm.[\/caption]\n\nStepping inside, however, thinks go from up North casual to that bustling feeling we've all come to know and love in brewpubs. All orders are taken at the counter - be they for food or beer - but wait staff actually brings the product to you once you grab a table flag and find a seat in one of two rooms.\n\nThe bar room is the one you enter walking into the storefront, but near the back of the space, there is a short set of stairs down into a larger (or at least more spacious) room. In that room, there is a nice stage for live music, and a number of hightop tables along the walls, and standard low-top tables with seating along the middle.\n\nI would have love to have the opportunity to see some live music there, and if it wasn't so remote, I would make a trip just to see that (and to get some more interesting beers - more about that in a moment). As it stands, it's likely something that won't happen without a special set of circumstances.\n<h3>The Beer<\/h3>\nSo, I mention that there weren't many great beers - or at least not exciting ones - on my trip to Short's. That is in direct contradiction with my opening paragraphs, no?\n\nWell, my speculation (the place was busy enough that I didn't want to hassle any waitstaff about it) is that, thanks to the Michigan Brewer's Guild summer festival in just a couple weeks, they're holding off on presenting many creative offerings in the brewpub until after that event.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1260\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/photo-2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1260\" title=\"Short's Brewing Company beers\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/photo-2-e1342628106203-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Short's Brewing Company beers\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> Flight paddle.[\/caption]\n\nRegardless, I wasn't going to drive that far North without trying a few brews - albeit a couple I'd had before - so I picked up a flight. The image at right shows (from near to far): 2009 Golden Rule, Alter Spalter, Autumn Ale, Spruce Pils, and The Magician.\n\nThe Spruce Pils tastes downright earthy, green, planty... it has the same flavor of the smell of a certain substance. I've had it before, this came as no surprise.\n\nThe beer that did surprise me - and again, it's one I'd had before - was The Magician. It's a nice brown ale, with plenty of toffee and caramel tastes in the malt experience. It's lightly hopped - though the Short's menu mentioned that makes it ideal for newcomers to beer (with the implication that it's not good for anyone else), about which I couldn't roll my eyes hard enough.\n\nThe other three beers were mostly non-notable. They were good, solid beers, as is expected. Any other week(s) of the year, however, I wouldn't have even bothered ordering them, instead opting for one of the more creative offerings you'd typically see on draft.\n<h3>Summary<\/h3>\nShort's is known as a good brewery, and making the trip didn't do anything to dissuade me from thinking that. It's in the middle of nowhere, both an annoyance and part of what makes it so special. It's worth making the journey only if you're headed in that direction anyway, but on a standard week with a more creative beer list - and the chance to see a bit of live music 0 it can make for an excellent experience.","post_title":"Beer Trip: Short's Brewing Company","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"1256-revision-5","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2012-07-19 19:26:26","post_modified_gmt":"2012-07-19 23:26:26","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"1256","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/07\/1256-revision-5\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

There were posts trying to figure out what to call this new style. Is it a Black IPA? A Robust Porter? Cascadian Dark Ale? The industry seems to have settled on Black IPA, and they've started becoming fairly commonplace.\r\n\r\nI remember the first BIPA I tried. I was at my go to bar, with my go to server (who has since changed jobs) looking down the draft list. I asked him if there was anything exciting, and he just nodded and started pouring me <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/147\/38470\">Stone Sublimely Self Righteous Ale<\/a>. I'm not sure if that was the first major BIPA, but I know it certainly was a lot of people's first BIPA. There are moments quaffing beer that are special, when you try something that you haven't tasted before. That was one of those moments.\r\n\r\nI continued to keep a look out for BIPAs and picked them up at bottle shops or ordered them at the bar when I found them. But after a while, more and more started showing up. Some of them still blow me away, but the hit rate seems to have gone down, and I tend to look for other styles.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1176\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/over.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1176\" title=\"over\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/over-300x161.png\" alt=\"Fred Armisen from Portlandia\" width=\"300\" height=\"161\" \/><\/a> BIPAS ARE OVER![\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis is where I push up my hipster glasses and tell you how much better it was before Black IPAs were mainstream. I do worry that I'm becoming a beer snob who will turn up his nose at a perfectly good pint. Well, I decided to give it another go, and picked up a bomber of <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/22951\/55019\">Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet Black IPA<\/a>. The brewer describes it:\r\n<blockquote>Hoppy Feet has been lovingly crafted by combining Premium malt with lots of Amarillo and Columbus Hops.  Grapefruit and Pine are balanced on the nose and on the palate by a nutty, dark chocolate, roasted backbone.<\/blockquote>\r\nThis has been knocking around in my \"cellar<sup><a id=\"1_text\" href=\"#1\">1<\/a><\/sup>\" for a while. I generally try to drink hoppy beers fresh. I think you get more of what the brewer is trying to produce that way. This may not be a completely fair shake, so I might try it from a tap if I see it around to compare.\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1172\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/tumblr_m67f9avhWz1rzr3i9o1_500.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1172\" title=\"tumblr_m67f9avhWz1rzr3i9o1_500\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/tumblr_m67f9avhWz1rzr3i9o1_500.jpg\" alt=\"Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a> Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet Black IPA[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>Appearance<\/strong>: The beer pours a very, dark copper, with very little translucence. Holding up it the light, you get some flashes of ruby. There was a one finger, creamy head that receded quickly down to about half a finger and remained there.\r\n\r\n<strong>Aroma<\/strong>: The aroma is a mix of a spicy hops with a strong caramel note from the malt base. The nose is incredibly well balanced.\r\n\r\n<strong>Taste<\/strong>: Unfortunately, the taste isn't as well balanced as the nose. The first flavor is a muted malt taste, that is immediately followed by an intense bitterness that mixes with alcohol heat and some acridity from the dark malts. The after taste is a lingering, coating bitterness that stays on my tongue.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mouthfeel<\/strong>: The beer is very smooth with a slightly heavy body for an IPA. There's a bit of carbonation from the bomber, but nothing too effervescent.\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall<\/strong>: Maybe I've just been in a <a href=\"http:\/\/yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/07\/recipe-impromptu-black-ipa\/ ‎\">BIPA<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/06\/brooklyn-waterfront-beer-festival\">overload<\/a>, but this beer doesn't really do much for me. The bitterness overpowers the malt flavors that I want, yet manages to accentuate the acridity that I would want to hide. Also, while I enjoy hoppy beers, I don't care for the lingering and sometimes muddy bitterness in a lot of IPAs. The best hop bombs, Firestone Walker Double Jack and Bell's Hopslam (short list, and strictly my opinion), have a great hop nose with a deceptively strong malt backbone to stand up to the hops. The bitterness also is cleaner, with more flavor, be it citrus, spice, earthiness, grassiness, rather than just unplaceable bitterness.\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><a id=\"1\"> <\/a>My \"cellar\" is a couple of cupboards above my microwave. <a href=\"#1_text\">&#8617;<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>","post_title":"Review: Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"1171-revision-6","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2012-06-25 23:48:39","post_modified_gmt":"2012-06-26 03:48:39","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"1171","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/06\/1171-revision-6\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Vanilla porters are somewhat common. Smoke beers are less rare than they have been. The combination still intrigued me enough to pick up a 12oz bottle.\r\n\r\nThis beer evokes to me the phrase that has lead to many innovations in brewing and elsewhere, \"Why the hell not?\" Stone had a perfectly successful beer in their Smoked Porter. Then… according to Stone:\r\n<blockquote>Stone brewer Laura Ulrich had a stroke of brilliance… what if she introduced whole Madagascar vanilla beans into a small batch?<\/blockquote>\r\nIf I see Laura (unlikely), I'm going to buy here a drink, because this is exactly what I love about personally about homebrewing and as a consumer about  craft brewing. Take a risk, go out on a limb, don't be afraid to fail. Stone has been doing that for a long time.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1238\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/tumblr_m70tpx8q6i1rzr3i9o1_500.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1238\" title=\"Stone Smoked Porter w\/ Vanilla Bean\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/tumblr_m70tpx8q6i1rzr3i9o1_500.jpeg\" alt=\"Stone Smoked Porter w\/ Vanilla Bean\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a> Stone Smoked Porter w\/ Vanilla Bean 5.9%[\/caption]\r\n<h3>Review<\/h3>\r\n<strong>Appearance<\/strong>: The beer pours a translucent copper with a creamy tan head that recedes quickly to a thin film on top of the beer. There are hints of dark ruby where the light hits the glass.\r\n\r\n<strong>Aroma<\/strong>: The aroma is incredibly rich with notes rough, smoky chocolate with a heavy, smooth vanilla note taking over at the end. A classic, rauchbier style smoke aroma isn't there. It's more a acrid, kilned malt smokiness.\r\n\r\n<strong>Taste<\/strong>: The taste starts off with a somewhat thin, very dark porter. Lots of dark, kilned malts giving an acrid, burnt flavor. There's a hint of bitterness as well, but nothing close to overpowering the malt. The flavor ends with a very well rounded, lush vanilla flavor the helps to clear the acridity from the palate. There is a lingering maltiness, but that dissipates after a few seconds.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mouthfeel<\/strong>: It starts off feeling a little thin, but I'm not sure if it's a unfermentable sugar in the beer or just an effect of the vanilla flavor, but the end of the sip feel rich and smooth.There's a light carbonation, the keeps the beer lively without overwhelming any of the flavors.\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall<\/strong>: I wasn't sure exactly what to expect here. I know I've had the Stone Smoked Porter before. It seemed more like a standard, dark, acrid porter than a rauchbier. This seems more along the lines of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ratebeer.com\/beer\/breckenridge-vanilla-porter\/21748\/\">Breckenridge Vanilla Porter<\/a>, but much, much drier.

{"ID":"1277","post_author":"2","post_date":"2012-07-26 06:00:58","post_date_gmt":"2012-07-26 10:00:58","post_content":"<a title=\"Review: Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/07\/review-clown-shoes-hoppy-feet\/\">Previously<\/a>, I had mentioned that I thought Black IPAs were getting too widespread. It seemed like every brewery <a title=\"Brooklyn Waterfront Beer Festival\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/06\/brooklyn-waterfront-beer-festival\/\">at the festival Nate and I went to<\/a> had 2 of either an IPA, IIPA, DIPA, BIPA or DIPA. I admit, after that festival and after that beer, I was pretty down on Black IPAs. I was just overloaded.\r\n\r\nAfter about a month of having an eclectic mix of beers, I am ready to dive back in a give it a go. It doesn't hurt that Stone makes, what I consider, the ideal <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stonebrew.com\/sublimely\/\">Black IPA<\/a>. I should mention that I picked this beer up while picking some items up at Whole Foods. I never really consider going there to pick up beers as their a grocery store (a rather pricey one at that), and I have a booze superstore 2 blocks away.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm a firm believer that one should always take a quick detour through a store's craft beer section. If you go to the same store all the time, you only get the beers picked out by one purchaser and delivered by those distributors. Even if the new store is not an amazing bottle shop, there's a decent chance you might find something interesting that you've never tried before, like this Stone Collaboration beer from 2011.\r\n\r\n<em>More Brown Than Black IPA <\/em>is a collaboration between Stone, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alchemistbeer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Alchemist<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ninkasibrewing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ninkasi<\/a>. The brewers came together after Hurricane Irene hit Vermont and essentially destroyed The Alchemist brewpub. In this video on Stone's youtube channel, John Kimmich talks about walking into his bar and brewery and seeing the discussion. They also talk about the beer:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3ObxHoa7DRM\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of this beer go to a worthy cause; now I just hope the beer is worthy!\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/25.media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_m7qvvaqYqT1rzr3i9o1_500.jpg\"><img title=\"Stone More Brown than Black IPA\" src=\"http:\/\/25.media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_m7qvvaqYqT1rzr3i9o1_500.jpg\" alt=\"Stone More Brown than Black IPA\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a> Stone More Brown than Black IPA with The Alchemist and Ninkasi[\/caption]\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\n<strong>Appearance<\/strong>: The beer is a dark, opaque brown. There are ruby sparks at the thin parts on the glass, but very little lights gets through. There was a of finger, bubbly white head that laced down the glass to a thin film over the top of the beer.\r\n\r\n<strong>Aroma<\/strong>: There's definitely hop notes in the nose. I'd say mostly resiny with spicy and floral notes. Underneath the hop aroma, really holding it up, is a rich, caramel-y malt smell. This is what these new style, dark IPAs should smell like.\r\n\r\n<strong>Taste<\/strong>: There's a lot of bitterness in this beer, and it really lingers after the sip. I wouldn't call it muddy or messy, but it's trending that way. After the initial taste of hops, the malts come into the taste. They are sweet, roasty with hints of caramel, and really balance with the hops and round out the beer. The sip finishes with some aggressive, lingering bitterness that is tempered and cleaned up by the sweetness of the malt and the bubbles from the carbonation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mouthfeel<\/strong>: This is a very rich, smooth beer. It doesn't have the dryness one normally associates with an IPA or, even, a Black IPA. It feels like a rich brown ale. The head on top contributes to this feel as well.\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall<\/strong>: I really like this beer. For my money, Stone has the best Black IPA out there, and this is a worthy sibling. The fact that a slice goes to charity is purely a bonus. Hopefully something like this beer makes it into production at Stone. This is what needs to happen in Dark IPAs.","post_title":"Review: Stone More Brown Than Black IPA","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"review-stone-more-brown-than-black-ipa","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2012-07-25 22:35:03","post_modified_gmt":"2012-07-26 02:35:03","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=1277","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Sweet rearview, bro.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nSince the Short's production facility is actually in Elk Rapids, about 30 miles from Bellaire, I took the Western route on the way up, and swung by the factory to experience its glory. It was not thrilling, and certainly not while I was just swinging by as I hustled to make it to the brewpub itself.\r\n\r\nElk Rapids is no metropolis itself, but is actually in a pretty cool location, on the channel between Elk Lake and the Grand Traverse Bay. As I said, I didn't head into the town itself too much.\r\n\r\nAs for the brewpub itself, I've already mentioned that it's... remote... and that's the case. The town of Bellaire consisted entirely of a couple blocks, and the brewery is on the Western edge of that town.\r\n<h3>Setting and Atmosphere<\/h3>\r\nBellaire is a quintessential resort town (but with no real reason to visit, other than the variety of lakes a short distance away, I guess), and Short's is one of the few things that seems like it would bring people into the town. From the outside, it's an unassuming building as part of a city block.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1259\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/photo-1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1259\" title=\"Short's Brewing Company Brewpub\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/photo-1-e1342627587308-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Short's Brewing Company Brewpub\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> The calm before the storm.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nStepping inside, however, thinks go from up North casual to that bustling feeling we've all come to know and love in brewpubs. All orders are taken at the counter - be they for food or beer - but wait staff actually brings the product to you once you grab a table flag and find a seat in one of two rooms.\r\n\r\nThe bar room is the one you enter walking into the storefront, but near the back of the space, there is a short set of stairs down into a larger (or at least more spacious) room. In that room, there is a nice stage for live music, and a number of hightop tables along the walls, and standard low-top tables with seating along the middle.\r\n\r\nI would have love to have the opportunity to see some live music there, and if it wasn't so remote, I would make a trip just to see that (and to get some more interesting beers - more about that in a moment). As it stands, it's likely something that won't happen without a special set of circumstances.\r\n<h3>The Beer<\/h3>\r\nSo, I mention that there weren't many great beers - or at least not exciting ones - on my trip to Short's. That is in direct contradiction with my opening paragraphs, no?\r\n\r\nWell, my speculation (the place was busy enough that I didn't want to hassle any waitstaff about it) is that, thanks to the Michigan Brewer's Guild summer festival in just a couple weeks, they're holding off on presenting many creative offerings in the brewpub until after that event.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1260\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/photo-2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1260\" title=\"Short's Brewing Company beers\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/photo-2-e1342628106203-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Short's Brewing Company beers\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> Flight paddle.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nRegardless, I wasn't going to drive that far North without trying a few brews - albeit a couple I'd had before - so I picked up a flight. The image at right shows (from near to far): 2009 Golden Rule, Alter Spalter, Autumn Ale, Spruce Pils, and The Magician.\r\n\r\nThe Spruce Pils tastes downright earthy, green, planty... it has the same flavor of the smell of a certain substance. I've had it before, this came as no surprise.\r\n\r\nThe beer that did surprise me - and again, it's one I'd had before - was The Magician. It's a nice brown ale, with plenty of toffee and caramel tastes in the malt experience. It's lightly hopped - though the Short's menu mentioned that makes it ideal for newcomers to beer (with the implication that it's not good for anyone else), about which I couldn't roll my eyes hard enough.\r\n\r\nThe other three beers were mostly non-notable. They were good, solid beers, as is expected. Any other week(s) of the year, however, I wouldn't have even bothered ordering them, instead opting for one of the more creative offerings you'd typically see on draft.\r\n<h3>Summary<\/h3>\r\nShort's is known as a good brewery, and making the trip didn't do anything to dissuade me from thinking that. It's in the middle of nowhere, both an annoyance and part of what makes it so special. It's worth making the journey only if you're headed in that direction anyway, but on a standard week with a more creative beer list - and the chance to see a bit of live music 0 it can make for an excellent experience.","post_title":"Beer Trip: Short's Brewing Company","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"beer-trip-shorts-brewing-company","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2012-07-19 19:26:49","post_modified_gmt":"2012-07-19 23:26:49","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/?p=1256","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

I had this \"cellaring\" for about 6 months before cracking it open. That's really nothing for this beer. I'd be curious to try it after sitting for a year or two.

I've had it before, this came as no surprise.\n\nThe beer that did surprise me - and again, it's one I'd had before - was The Magician. It's a nice brown ale, with plenty of toffee and caramel tastes in the malt experience. It's lightly hopped - though the Short's menu mentioned that makes it ideal for newcomers to beer (with the implication that it's not good for anyone else), about which I couldn't roll my eyes hard enough.\n\nThe other three beers were mostly non-notable. They were good, solid beers, as is expected. Any other week(s) of the year, however, I wouldn't have even bothered ordering them, instead opting for one of the more creative offerings you'd typically see on draft.\n<h3>Summary<\/h3>\nShort's is known as a good brewery, and making the trip didn't do anything to dissuade me from thinking that. It's in the middle of nowhere, both an annoyance and part of what makes it so special. It's worth making the journey only if you're headed in that direction anyway, but on a standard week with a more creative beer list - and the chance to see a bit of live music 0 it can make for an excellent experience.","post_title":"Beer Trip: Short's Brewing Company","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"1256-autosave","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2012-07-19 19:53:43","post_modified_gmt":"2012-07-19 23:53:43","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"1256","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/07\/1256-autosave\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Vanilla porters are somewhat common. Smoke beers are less rare than they have been. The combination still intrigued me enough to pick up a 12oz bottle.\n\nThis beer evokes to me the phrase that has lead to many innovations in brewing and elsewhere, \"Why the hell not?\" Stone had a perfectly successful beer in their Smoked Porter. Then… according to Stone:\n<blockquote>Stone brewer Laura Ulrich had a stroke of brilliance… what if she introduced whole Madagascar vanilla beans into a small batch?<\/blockquote>\nIf I see Laura (unlikely), I'm going to buy here a drink, because this is exactly what I love about personally about homebrewing and as a consumer about  craft brewing. Take a risk, go out on a limb, don't be afraid to fail. Stone has been doing that for a long time.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1238\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/tumblr_m70tpx8q6i1rzr3i9o1_500.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1238\" title=\"Stone Smoked Porter w\/ Vanilla Bean\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/tumblr_m70tpx8q6i1rzr3i9o1_500.jpeg\" alt=\"Stone Smoked Porter w\/ Vanilla Bean\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a> Stone Smoked Porter w\/ Vanilla Bean 5.9%[\/caption]\n<h3>Review<\/h3>\n<strong>Appearance<\/strong>: The beer pours a translucent copper with a creamy tan head that recedes quickly to a thin film on top of the beer. There are hints of dark ruby where the light hits the glass.\n\n<strong>Aroma<\/strong>: The aroma is incredibly rich with notes rough, smoky chocolate with a heavy, smooth vanilla note taking over at the end. A classic, rauchbier style smoke aroma isn't there. It's more a acrid, kilned malt smokiness.\n\n<strong>Taste<\/strong>: The taste starts off with a somewhat thin, very dark porter. Lots of dark, kilned malts giving an acrid, burnt flavor. There's a hint of bitterness as well, but nothing close to overpowering the malt. The flavor ends with a very well rounded, lush vanilla flavor the helps to clear the acridity from the palate. There is a lingering maltiness, but that dissipates after a few seconds.\n\n<strong>Mouthfeel<\/strong>: It starts off feeling a little thin, but I'm not sure if it's a unfermentable sugar in the beer or just an effect of the vanilla flavor, but the end of the sip feel rich and smooth.There's a light carbonation, the keeps the beer lively without overwhelming any of the flavors.\n\n<strong>Overall<\/strong>: I wasn't sure exactly what to expect here. I know I've had the Stone Smoked Porter before. It seemed more like a standard, dark, acrid porter than a rauchbier. This seems more along the lines of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ratebeer.com\/beer\/breckenridge-vanilla-porter\/21748\/\">Breckenridge Vanilla Porter<\/a>, but much, much drier. It's an enjoyable beer, and the flavors work quite well together. I'm interested in trying the smoked porter with chipotle, but I doubt it will be as aggressive as our <a title=\"Pepper Porter v2.0\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2010\/09\/pepper-porter-v2-0\/\">Pepper Porter<\/a> or the <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/17232\/51748\/\">440 Pepper Smoker<\/a> from <a href=\"http:\/\/ogbrewing.com\/\">Original Gravity<\/a>.","post_title":"Review: Stone Smoked Porter w\/ Vanilla Bean","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"1236-autosave","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2012-07-25 00:48:10","post_modified_gmt":"2012-07-25 04:48:10","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"1236","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/07\/1236-autosave\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

I admit, after that festival and after that beer, I was pretty down on Black IPAs. I was just overloaded.\n\nAfter about a month of having an eclectic mix of beers, I am ready to dive back in a give it a go. It doesn't hurt that Stone makes, what I consider, the ideal <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stonebrew.com\/sublimely\/\">Black IPA<\/a>. I should mention that I picked this beer up while picking some items up at Whole Foods. I never really consider going there to pick up beers as their a grocery store (a rather pricey one at that), and I have a booze superstore 2 blocks away.\n\nHowever, I'm a firm believer that one should always take a quick detour through a store's craft beer section. If you go to the same store all the time, you only get the beers picked out by one purchaser and delivered by those distributors. Even if the new store is not an amazing bottle shop, there's a decent chance you might find something interesting that you've never tried before, like this Stone Collaboration beer from 2011.\n\n<em>More Brown Than Black IPA <\/em>is a collaboration between Stone, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alchemistbeer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Alchemist<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ninkasibrewing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ninkasi<\/a>.

There are ruby sparks at the thin parts on the glass, but very little lights gets through. There was a of finger, bubbly white head that laced down the glass to a thin film over the top of the beer.\n\n<strong>Aroma<\/strong>: There's definitely hop notes in the nose. I'd say mostly resiny with spicy and floral notes. Underneath the hop aroma, really holding it up, is a rich, caramel-y malt smell. This is what these new style, dark IPAs should smell like.\n\n<strong>Taste<\/strong>: There's a lot of bitterness in this beer, and it really lingers after the sip. I wouldn't call it muddy or messy, but it's trending that way. After the initial taste of hops, the malts come into the taste. They are sweet, roasty with hints of caramel, and really balance with the hops and round out the beer. The sip finishes with some aggressive, lingering bitterness that is tempered and cleaned up by the sweetness of the malt and the bubbles from the carbonation.\n\n<strong>Mouthfeel<\/strong>: This is a very rich, smooth beer. It doesn't have the dryness one normally associates with an IPA or, even, a Black IPA. It feels like a rich brown ale. The head on top contributes to this feel as well.\n\n<strong>Overall<\/strong>: I really like this beer. For my money, Stone has the best Black IPA out there, and this is a worthy sibling. The fact that a slice goes to charity is purely a bonus. Hopefully something like this beer makes it into production at Stone. This is what needs to happen in Dark IPAs.","post_title":"Review: Stone More Brown Than Black IPA","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"1277-revision","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2012-07-25 22:28:00","post_modified_gmt":"2012-07-26 02:28:00","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"1277","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/07\/1277-revision\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

{"ID":"1284","post_author":"2","post_date":"2012-07-25 22:33:22","post_date_gmt":"2012-07-26 02:33:22","post_content":"<a title=\"Review: Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/07\/review-clown-shoes-hoppy-feet\/\">Previously<\/a>, I had mentioned that I thought Black IPAs were getting too widespread. It seemed like every brewery <a title=\"Brooklyn Waterfront Beer Festival\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/06\/brooklyn-waterfront-beer-festival\/\">at the festival Nate and I went to<\/a> had 2 of either an IPA, IIPA, DIPA, BIPA or DIPA. I admit, after that festival and after that beer, I was pretty down on Black IPAs. I was just overloaded.\r\n\r\nAfter about a month of having an eclectic mix of beers, I am ready to dive back in a give it a go. It doesn't hurt that Stone makes, what I consider, the ideal <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stonebrew.com\/sublimely\/\">Black IPA<\/a>. I should mention that I picked this beer up while picking some items up at Whole Foods. I never really consider going there to pick up beers as their a grocery store (a rather pricey one at that), and I have a booze superstore 2 blocks away.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm a firm believer that one should always take a quick detour through a store's craft beer section. If you go to the same store all the time, you only get the beers picked out by one purchaser and delivered by those distributors. Even if the new store is not an amazing bottle shop, there's a decent chance you might find something interesting that you've never tried before, like this Stone Collaboration beer from 2011.\r\n\r\n<em>More Brown Than Black IPA <\/em>is a collaboration between Stone, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alchemistbeer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Alchemist<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ninkasibrewing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ninkasi<\/a>. The brewers came together after Hurricane Irene hit Vermont and essentially destroyed The Alchemist brewpub. In this video on Stone's youtube channel, John Kimmich talks about walking into his bar and brewery and seeing the discussion. They also talk about the beer:\r\n\r\n<object width=\"584\" height=\"329\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"src\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/3ObxHoa7DRM?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" \/><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><embed width=\"584\" height=\"329\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/3ObxHoa7DRM?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" \/><\/object>\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of this beer go to a worthy cause; now I just hope the beer is worthy!\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/25.media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_m7qvvaqYqT1rzr3i9o1_500.jpg\"><img title=\"Stone More Brown than Black IPA\" src=\"http:\/\/25.media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_m7qvvaqYqT1rzr3i9o1_500.jpg\" alt=\"Stone More Brown than Black IPA\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a> Stone More Brown than Black IPA with The Alchemist and Ninkasi[\/caption]\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\n<strong>Appearance<\/strong>: The beer is a dark, opaque brown. There are ruby sparks at the thin parts on the glass, but very little lights gets through. There was a of finger, bubbly white head that laced down the glass to a thin film over the top of the beer.\r\n\r\n<strong>Aroma<\/strong>: There's definitely hop notes in the nose. I'd say mostly resiny with spicy and floral notes. Underneath the hop aroma, really holding it up, is a rich, caramel-y malt smell. This is what these new style, dark IPAs should smell like.\r\n\r\n<strong>Taste<\/strong>: There's a lot of bitterness in this beer, and it really lingers after the sip. I wouldn't call it muddy or messy, but it's trending that way. After the initial taste of hops, the malts come into the taste. They are sweet, roasty with hints of caramel, and really balance with the hops and round out the beer. The sip finishes with some aggressive, lingering bitterness that is tempered and cleaned up by the sweetness of the malt and the bubbles from the carbonation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mouthfeel<\/strong>: This is a very rich, smooth beer. It doesn't have the dryness one normally associates with an IPA or, even, a Black IPA. It feels like a rich brown ale. The head on top contributes to this feel as well.\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall<\/strong>: I really like this beer. For my money, Stone has the best Black IPA out there, and this is a worthy sibling. The fact that a slice goes to charity is purely a bonus. Hopefully something like this beer makes it into production at Stone. This is what needs to happen in Dark IPAs.","post_title":"Review: Stone More Brown Than Black IPA","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"1277-revision-6","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2012-07-25 22:33:22","post_modified_gmt":"2012-07-26 02:33:22","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"1277","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/07\/1277-revision-6\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

It was a Friday night. At my previous job, we got out at noon on Fridays, and that particular day I had to go down to the DMV in the Loop. Since it was also Chicago Craft Beer Week, I figured, why not bar crawl my way back up to my place? I don't get down to that area all that often, and there were some places I was interested in going.\r\n\r\nI IMed Tim throughout the day, and finally sent him a custom Google Map of my route. This proved helpful, since on my bar crawl, I happened to be <em>overserved. <\/em>Couple that with my phone dying, and Nate got into to town and had no where to go. He called Tim, who used the map to play detective and called up the places I had been earlier that. Unfortunately, that didn't help too much that much, since I was passed out on my couch.\r\n\r\nEventually (around 1a) I woke up, called Nate, and brought him up to my apartment, apologizing profusely along the way. We stayed up for a while, drank a bottle of Rodenbach Grand Cru, and eventually passed out around 6a.\r\n\r\nWhat does this delightful story have to do with the beer in question? Well, at some point on my impromptu bar crawl, I ended up stopping at a bottle shot and picking up a mixed six pack, including Three Philosophers. I had seen it at Binny's a few times, and been tempted, but I didn't want to pull the trigger on a $12 bomber. This option was a 12oz bottle, presumably for less (my inhibitions were limited at that point anyway).\r\n\r\nI've been meaning to drink it for a while, but haven't for one reason or another. It's actually a 2010 vintage, which means it's been aging for at least 18 months. This makes it the longest cellaring project I've ever done. Maybe it comes with maturity. I have a couple bottles of Russian River along with a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ratebeer.com\/beer\/two-brothers-hoodwink\/156867\/\" target=\"_blank\">Two Brothers Hoodwink<\/a> that I'm sitting for a while. Anyway, on to the review…\r\n<h3>Tasting Notes<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/tumblr_m6azxp1OTb1rzr3i9o1_500.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1205 aligncenter\" title=\"tumblr_m6azxp1OTb1rzr3i9o1_500\" src=\"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/tumblr_m6azxp1OTb1rzr3i9o1_500.jpeg\" alt=\"Ommegang Three Philosophers\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<strong>Appearance:<\/strong> The beer pours smooth and viscous. It's coppery with hints of ruby where the light strikes it. It had a two finger, thick, khaki head that gracefully laced down to a thin layer on top.\r\n\r\n<strong>Aroma:<\/strong> The aroma is heavy with tart cherry with a sweet malty backbone. There's a background suggestion of the alcohol heat as well.\r\n\r\n<strong>Taste:<\/strong> The cherrie's aren't as heavy in the taste. Instead there is a raisin\/prune flavor from the malt (Special B? Dark Crystal?). The malt really shines throughout the taste of this beer, and helps tamp down the alcohol heat. That heat is felt, rather than tasted, which is always welcome. The finish is where the cherries come in. For a rich beer, it finish with a very clean, slightly tart flavor from the cherries. Very nice. I'm letting it warm as I drink it. I'm hoping some more flavors may appear.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mouthfeel:<\/strong> This beer is silky smooth and has some weight to it. Definitely one to sip slowly and enjoy.\r\n\r\n<strong>Overall:<\/strong> I'm not sure it's necessary for me to say this is a good beer. That seems to be an <a href=\"http:\/\/beeradvocate.com\/beer\/profile\/42\/3457\/\" target=\"_blank\">established<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ratebeer.com\/beer\/ommegang-three-philosophers\/13667\/\" target=\"_blank\">fact<\/a>. I had never had this beer before tonight, despite having the bottle for over a year, and first resolving to try it over two years ago. All in all, it was worth the wait. It had a lot of hype to live up to and met it easily. I am glad I only have 12oz bottle instead of a bomber, though.","post_title":"Review: Ommegang Three Philosophers","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"1204-revision-3","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2012-06-27 21:57:33","post_modified_gmt":"2012-06-28 01:57:33","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"1204","guid":"http:\/\/www.yeastboundanddown.com\/2012\/06\/1204-revision-3\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},
