Recipe: Return of the Yeast Brown Ale
=====================================

This was our first attempt to reuse the yeast cake in our carboy. This cake was from the Sullivan Stout (WLP007). Other than that, it was a fairly standard Brown Ale. As predicted, the beer started up very quickly and fermented in a couple days.

### Grain

*   8lbs Maris Otter

*   .75lbs Crystal 60ºL

*   1lb American Victory

*   .5lb Belgian Special B

### Extract

*   1lbs Dark Malt Extract

### Hops

*   .5 oz Kent Goldings (5% AA) 60 minutes

*   .25 oz Kent Goldings (5% AA) 30 minutes

*   .25 oz Kent Goldings (5% AA) 15 minutes

### Yeast

*   White Labs Dry English Ale Yeast ([WLP007](http://www.whitelabs.com/beer/strains_wlp007.html "Dry English Ale Yeast"))

We mashed the grain for an hour with about 3gal of 165ºF water and sparged with about 3 gallons of 170ºF water. The final boil volume was 4 gallons and we added another 1 gallon of purified water.
