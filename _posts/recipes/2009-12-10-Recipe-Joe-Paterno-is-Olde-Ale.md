Recipe: Joe Paterno is Olde Ale
===============================

This was our first successful all-grain brew.  We used a 5gallon cooler with a false bottom and valve fashioned out of parts from the local hardware store.  This is probably my favorite beer that we've made so far. It's rich, complex and malty with a great caramel to amber color.

The grain bill is taken exactly from [here](http://www.drydockbrewing.com/Recipes/HMSBountyOldAleAllGrain/tabid/619/Default.aspx "HMS Bounty Olde Ale"), and we switched up the hops to keep it to 1oz each of two different varieties. So, without further adieu:

### Grain

*   12.5lbs Maris Otter

*   1.25lbs Crystal 60ºL

*   .5lbs Carapils

*   .25lbs Special B

### Hops

*   1oz Nothern Brewer (8.0%) Bittering

*   1oz Kent Goldings (4.0%) Flavor

### Yeast

*   White Labs English Ale Yeast ([WLP002](http://www.whitelabs.com/beer/strains_wlp002.html "English Ale Yeast"))

We mashed for a little over an hour right around 165ºF with 3.5gal of water. We ran the mash through 2 additional times to set the grain bed then added 170ºF water to sparge until we got 4.5gal to start the boil.

We added the Northern Brewer at the hotbreak and the Kent Goldings 45 minutes into the boil with a teaspoon of Irish Moss. After 60 minutes we cooled it, racked it to the carboy with the yeast in the bottom already and added about a gallon of water to get it just over 5gal.
