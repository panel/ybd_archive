Dark Mild Recipe
================

**The Ingredients**

*   1 lb American Crystal Malt 40L

*   1 lb Flaked Maize

*   4 oz British Chocolate Malt

*   6.6 lbs Liquid Light Malt Extract

*   .5 lbs Brown Sugar

*   1oz Fuggle

*   1oz Kent Goldings

### The Process

*   Bring ≈3.5 gals of water up to heat.

*   Add crystal, flaked maize, and chocolate malt in muslin bag until the water reaches 170ºF. This should take about 30 minutes.

*   Remove spent grains and bring mixture to boil.

*   Add liquid malt and brown sugar.

*   Return to a boil and add the Golding hops

*   After the boil is completed (60 minute mark) cool, and add an additional 2 gallons of purified water.

*   Add Fuggle hops.

### The Stats

*   Original Gravity: 1.058

*   Bitterness: 12 IBU

*   Color: 41 HCU (~19 SRM)

*   Alcohol Content: 6.8% ABV

Using the English Ale Yeast, we set out to create a maltier beer than our other brews. Mild beers were the other side of the coin from Bitters (and ESBs) in English Pubs. Milds weren't aged for long, so they needed very little hops, [the preservative in beer](http://www.panel-creations.com/varsity_brew/2009/06/bare-bones-basics-2-hops/). 'Mild' refers to the bitterness, not the alcohol content. However, during World War I, several taxes added to alcohol forced pubs to reduce the gravity of these beers to avoid being taxed. Their minimal amount of alcohol was continued after the war (though it did increase some). This beer is a more traditional Dark Mild than the more modern examples. In the 1800s and before, these beers were anywhere from 5.5-7%.

What can we say? We're purists.

After this beer is racked from the carboy, we plan on immediately adding a stout directly onto the yeast cake. This will speed fermentation  great deal (also saving a couple bucks, not having to buy additional yeast).
