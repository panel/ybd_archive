Peanut Butter Porter Recipe
===========================

This was the first recipe we've every put together ourselves.  Our first two beers were made from pre-packaged kits, which is a great way to start, but we felt like we were ready to experiment and mess around. After going to the Ann Arbor Brewers Guild meeting a few days before, we were inspired to do something beyond malt, grain, hops and yeast. We all like peanut butter, and we all like beer, so it seemed like a natural combination.

### The Ingredients

*   1lb American Crystal Malt 10L

*   ½lb British Chocolate Malt

*   3.3lbs Liquid Dark Malt Extract

*   6lbs Dry Dark Malt Extract

*   2lbs Trader Joe's Organic, All Natural Peanut Butter

*   1oz Perle

*   1oz Saaz

### The Process

*   Bring ≈3 gals of water up to heat

*   Between 160-170ºF add grains in muslin bag and remove from heat. Allow to steep for 30 minutes.

*   Remove spent grains (we didn't sparge) and bring mixture to boil.

*   Once it starts boiling mix  in the extracts and peanut butter. We didn't try to get the oil out of the peanut butter. This didn't have any oil added and it didn't appear to be much on top.

*   Once malt/peanut butter is mixed in, add 1oz Perle hops and mix in. Start boil timer.

*   50 minutes in/10 minutes from the end add 10z Saaz and mix in.

### The Stats

*   Original Gravity: 1.083

*   Bitterness: 19 IBU

*   Color: 160 HCU (~48 SRM)

*   Alcohol Content: 9.1% ABV (maybe a bit higher with the peanut butter)

We used the Crytal Malt 10L  mainly for the head retention in order to offset the oil in the peanut butter. Also, Crystal has enzymes in it that can help break down non-malted sugars like those found in the peanut butter. The chocolate malt was for color as well as the nutty, toastiness it gave the beer. We ended up taking out a lot of the peanut butter solids off the top near the end of boil.

The beer smelled amazing during the boil.  I'm hoping it's not too sweet with the peanut butter, but it had a more balanced scent once the second round of hops were added.  Also, the fermentation process should cut the sweetness quite a bit.  The peanut smell is certainly there, but it plays well with the maltiness. Hopefully the hops can balance out the sweetness and maltiness enough.  This is the beer I'm most excited to try at this point. Waiting 3-4 weeks is going to be really tough.
