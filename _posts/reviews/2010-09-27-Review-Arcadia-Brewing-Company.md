Review: Arcadia Brewing Company
===============================

### The Location:

103 West Michigan Avenue - Battle Creek, Michigan

### The Facts:

Arcadia Brewing Company, the producer of Arcadia Ales, opened in 1996 in downtown Battle Creek, during a revamp period in area spurred by a request by Kellogg for the city to unghettofy or else they would move out of the area  (and when the largest employer of your city gives you an ultimatum, you obey). They rock a 25-barrel Peter Austin system and are in the process of adding additional fermentation tanks.

Several of their beers are hopped with locally grown hops picked from the fields owned by Jolly Pumpkin in Dexter, MI.

### Notable Beers:

*   Arcadia Amber Ale - American Amber

*   Arcadia Angle Ale - English Pale

*   Arcadia IPA - IPA

*   Arcadia Jaw Jacker -  Pumpkin Ale

*   Arcadia Whitsun - Witbier

*   Arcadia Hopmouth Double IPA -DIPA

*   Arcadia London Porter - Porter

*   Arcadia Scotch Ale - Scotch Ale

*   Arcadia Nut Brown - Brown Ale

*   Arcadia Cannonball Gold - Wheat Ale

*   Arccadia Cereal Killer - Barley Wine

### Review:

As the only brewery in my hometown of Battle Creek, I have a special attachment to this place. Most of their beers are decent to good (the Scotch Ale is phenomenal). None of their beers I've had do I really dislike, though the wheat beers aren't exactly my style (few are).

Pricing is average, generally around $4/pint, with a few of the larger beers being abound $5.  They have typical brewpub food, that is pretty good, but expensive, and a staff that at least knows a bit about the process/beers, even if they can't tell you the exact type of hops added in a particular beer.

Bottle of Arcadia Ales can be found throughout Michigan and in other parts of the midwest, and is turning into a top 5 Michigan brewery in terms of distribution. If you haven't tried any of their beer, and see it in the story, I'd recommend picking up a sixer (try the Scotch!).
