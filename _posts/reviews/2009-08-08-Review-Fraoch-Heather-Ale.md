Review: Fraoch Heather Ale
==========================

Fraoch Heather Ale is not only Scotch-style, but is also actually imported from Scotland - where they've been brewing it for more than 4000 years(!). On the nose, this beer is fairly fruity, though the aroma doesn't really find its way into the flavor. It has a light feel, and finishes cleanly. As far as flavor, it doesn't taste as malty as I usually expect Scotch Ales to be, and doesn't have the flavor of a slightly stronger beer, though not all Scotch Ales are higher in alcohol content, those are the type that I've experienced. Though the flowery, fruity aroma doesn't make its way into the flavor, there is a honey flavor added. The suggested serving temperature of Fraoch Heather Ale is slightly warmer than the fridge.
