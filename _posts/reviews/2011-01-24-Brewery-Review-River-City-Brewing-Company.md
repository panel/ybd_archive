Brewery Review: River City Brewing Company
==========================================

I was recently in Jacksonville, Florida, for a game [of which we shall not speak](http://mgoblog.com/content/moon-disaster). Jacksonville is a city that seems to be set up to cater to tourists, an odd choice for a city that has no real tourist attractions (outside of an NFL franchise and a bowl game). It's also trying to cultivate a reputation as a brewing city, with the Riverside Brewing District serving as the centerpiece. This district, however, is in the middle of a really bad area of downtown, and doesn't seem to be particularly accessible to tourists, so I strongly recommend against trying to check it out.

The final selection was the Red Rooster Ale, which is - you guessed it - a Red Ale. This beer (like most of their choices, it seems) was German-inspired, and tasted almost like a Kolsch despite being a true ale. It had a lot of the flavor characteristics you expect from a true German beer, and had good balance throughout. There was nothing spectacular about the beer in any way, but it was a solid selection.

In all, I would recommend checking out the River City Brewing Company if ever you find yourself in Jacksonville - though I wouldn't make a special trip just for the brewery.
