Beer Review: Hop Rod Rye
========================

![Hop Rod Rye](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/wpid-IMG_20101005_203808.jpg)

So the problem with going to [Binny's](http://www.binnys.com/index.cfm) is that despite the individual prices being lower, I always end up picking one or two extra things. After writing the review of the Cane and Ebel, this Bomber of rye ale caught my eye. It's made by [Bear Republic](http://bearrepublic.com/) in Healdsburg, CA who describes it as:

> …a high performance, turbo charged, alcohol burnin', monster ale with dual overhead hop injection, made with 18% rye.

From what I've read 18% rye is pushing right to the edge where it becomes overpowering, but I haven't met a rye beer I haven't liked, so I picked up and threw it in the fridge for a piece.

It pours a very nice ruby brown with a really thick, creamy off white head. The hops aren't quite as strong in the aroma as they are in Cane and Ebel or Red's Rye and they certainly do not skew citrusy. The aroma is more floral or herbaceous with a sweet, spicy note. The beer has a medium to full mouthfeel with the rye spiciness right up front with a soft alcohol burn at the end.

Considering this is an 18oz bomber for $5, I'd probably pick it up again.
