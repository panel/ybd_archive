Review: Alba Scots Pine Ale
===========================

Williams Brothers make some interesting beers. I've written about their [elderberry beer](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2010/11/review-williams-brothers-ebulum/ "Review: William’s Brothers Ebulum") earlier, and I haven't quite had the cajones to give their [seaweed beer Kelpie](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/12142/1556) a go.

Pine needles actually have a long history in brewing. In colonial American, many homebrewers would just use pine needles or spruce tips as a bittering agent since they were plentiful and much easier to cultivate initially than hops.

**Appearance**: The beer poured a dark, coppery amber with a finger or two of creamy head that has dissipated quickly. There are some bubbles floating up from the bottom.

**Aroma**: The beer smells very sweet with a hint of the pine. There's some floral notes in there too, but I'm not sure where they're from.

**Taste**: Very sweet. Fruit, molasses and brown sugar come to the front. Not much bitterness at all. I'm searching for that resinous, piney flavor, but it's just not there. The taste is almost all malts and yeast.

**Mouthfeel**: The carbonation could actually be a bit higher. The beer is a bit cloying as it is. The extra bubbles could help brighten it up a little. Overall, it's a bit heavy and sweet.

**Overall**: I was honestly hoping for more aromatics from the pine. If it wasn't on the bottle, I honestly never would have guessed that there was any pine in this beer.
