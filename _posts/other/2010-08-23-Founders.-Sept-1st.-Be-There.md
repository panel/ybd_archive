Founders. Sept 1st. Be There
============================

**[Founders](http://www.foundersbrewing.com/foundersnew/)**, for my money, is the best brewery in Michigan. If you haven't tried their beer yet, well, you should. I'm from the Grand Rapids area, and every time I head home to see the family I try to get out to their tap house which has $3.75 (!) pints of many of their brews. The only beer clone we've ever brewed was an [imitation of Red's Rye](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2010/06/recipe-reds-rye-clone/).

What I'm trying to get at is that Founders is awesome. One of the biggest reasons for this, is how much they still seem to have that homebrewer's mindset. They're always experimenting, coming up with interesting and innovative beers. The best example of this may be their [Nemesis Ale](http://www.foundersbrewing.com/foundersnew/beer/). Here's how the brewers describe it:

> What you have here is a rarity. A special, one-of-a-kind ale that is only made once a year. Sometimes that’s all. Forever. No more. Nada. Limited-time only. You never know what you’re gonna get. But you can be sure that it’ll be damn tasty.

This beer will be released on September 1st at their Grand Rapids taproom. Before then, only a handful of people will really know what it tastes like or even the style. One thing you can know, is that it will not be boring.

If taking a risk isn't your thing, well they're also releasing this year's [**Breakfast Stout**](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1199/11757) on the 1st as well.

I _was_ planning on heading to start my move to Chicago on September 1st, but it might just be worthwhile to postpone that for a day to get my hands on some of the best beer in Michigan, the USA and possibly the world.
