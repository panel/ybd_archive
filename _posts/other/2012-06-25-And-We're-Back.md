And We're Back
==============

This blog started out as a way for the three of us to keep notes on our brewing, keep recipes, and try to get better as aspiring home brewers. As we continued on drinking, brewing and blogging, this site grew, actually had some good content and maybe one or two readers.

A little over a year ago, I got really busy working full time while taking grad school courses, Nate was working a lot of hours out Vail and Tim had lost his two brew-mates. The content wound down, and one thing lead to anotherâ€¦ all of a sudden there was a gap from May 2011 to May 2012. Whoops.

There are a lot of things that have changed in our worlds and the beer world in the hiatus. I've still been drinking and brewing, now I'm going to try to get back to the third word of the slogan.
