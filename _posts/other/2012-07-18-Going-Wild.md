Going Wild
==========

I've mentioned a lot of times that one of my favorite things about brewing is trying to new things and trying to create something I haven't tasted before. One of our first beers was a [Peanut Butter Porter](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2009/06/peanut-butter-porter-recipe/ "Peanut Butter Porter Recipe"). One of our favorite beers that we made was our [Chili Pepper Porter](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2010/08/chili-pepper-beer-recipe/ "Chili Pepper Beer Recipe").There's something exciting about doing something you've done before to make something you've never tasted before.

Jordan and I brewed another batch of our [Rye Saison](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2012/07/recipe-rye-saison/ "Recipe: Rye Saison") a few weeks ago. As we were brewing, we threw out a few different ideas. We thought about doing jalapeños, black peppercorns, sage and few a others. Eventually we landed on funky-ing up our beer with some _Brettanomyces._

_Brett_ is in the same family as almost all brewing yeasts, but it attacks sugar in a somewhat different way. We used [Wyeast 3711 (French Saison)](http://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=199) in primary. This yeast eats most of the simple sugars and outputs most of the booze. The first batch this was all we used. We pitched the _Brett_ in secondary, after the Saison yeast did most of its work. During this phase, this yeast attacks the more complicated sugars in the wort and produces slightly more booze but also acetic acid and esters that give it that barnyard or horse blanket smell.

There are a few different varieties to choose from, but we ended up choosing [Wyeast 5526 (_Brettanomyces_ _Lambicus_™)](http://www.wyeastlab.com/hb_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=147) _._ The description from Wyeast is:

> This is a wild yeast strain isolated from Belgian lambic beers. It produces a pie cherry-like flavor and sourness along with distinct “Brett” character.

I'm thinking the tartness and fruitiness will work well with the yeasty, dry flavors of the Saison. We won't know what the end result will be for a few months, but I'm already excited.

We have half of the Saison in secondary without any doctoring. We might even be able to mix at the end. There's a decent chance that this won't work out, but it's almost always worth the risk for the chance of creating something new.
