Michigan Brewer's Guild Winter Festival
=======================================

![Michigan Brewers Guild Winter Beer Festival](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/mbgwinter.gif "Michigan Brewers Guild Winter Beer Festival")

Tomorrow is the big day. We're ready to take the world of Michigan craft brewers by storm, one beer at a time. Here's [the full list of participating breweries and their beers](http://www.mbgmash.org/?p=496) - though some breweries will bring along offerings not on the roster.

There's a damn good chance we don't get to try everything on this list, and I can guarantee that we'll try a couple things we haven't singled out yet. That's part of what makes the Brewer's Festival so much fun, right?

In order to make this easier on ourselves, we're going to drink the two preceding nights as well. Wait, wait, wait: hear me out. We plan on spending Thursday night (I'm writing this in advance because who knows how much I'll feel like writing in between sessions of debauchery) checking out [what Ann Arbor has to offer](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2010/12/if-at-first-you-dont-enjoy/) - and drinking some beer festival beers [I've already bought](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2011/02/jolly-pumpkin-release-bambic-and-collababeire/) - and if we can cross anything off our list ahead of time, it'll make things easier for us Saturday afternoon. We plan to do the same Friday night in Grand Rapids. Who knows, maybe we'll pick up a recipe and brew a batch of our own on Friday afternoon.

Should be an excellent weekend.
