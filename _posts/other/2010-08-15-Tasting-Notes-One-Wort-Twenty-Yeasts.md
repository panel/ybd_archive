Tasting Notes - One Wort Twenty Yeasts
======================================

Waaaay back in early June, Original Gravity Brewing in Milan hosted the Ann Arbor Brewer's Guild for the One wort 20 yeasts experiment. The concept is... exactly as it sounds. The same wort was fermented with twenty different White Labs yeasts, in order to examine the effect that yeast strain had on the final taste of the beer.

The official AABG tasting notes can be [found on their website](http://aabg.org/2010/06/14/tasting-notes-from-the-1-wort-20-yeasts-experiment/), and our notes are listed after the yeast strain for each of the different beers that we tried. I'll go out on a limb and say their notes are much more detailed than ours (but then, most of them have been brewing and drinking a lot longer than we have):

2.  WLP001 California Ale Yeast

4.  WLP002 English Ale Yeast

6.  WLP004 Irish Ale Yeast

8.  WLP005 British Ale Yeast

10.  WLP007 Dry English Ale Yeast - Less hoppy than 9.

12.  WLP008 East Coast Ale Yeast

14.  WLP009 Australian Ale Yeast

16.  WLP011 European Ale Yeast - Slightly dry, earthy, not as hoppy.

18.  WLP028 Edinburgh Scottish Ale Yeast More full than 5.

20.  WLP029 German Ale/Kolsch Yeast

22.  WLP036 Dusseldorf Alt Yeast - Citrus. Slight more malty than 8. We may have switched cups here, because this one tasted more like a trappist.

24.  WLP041 Pacific Ale Yeast

26.  WLP051 California Ale Yeast - More citrus than 1. Ester flavors.

28.  WLP060 American Ale Yeast Blend

30.  WLP080 Cream Ale Yeast Blend - Texture thicker than #4, but more dry.

32.  WLP500 Trappist Ale Yeast

34.  WLP550 Belgian Ale Yeast

36.  WLP566 Belgian Saison II Yeast

38.  WLP810 San Francisco Lager Yeast

40.  WLP862 Cry Havoc - Black pepper flavor.

Note that most of our notes are simply comparisons to another of the yeasts - because we tried them in batches of three or four. Some of them may have gotten... confused. More in-depth notes may or may not be posted at a later date.
