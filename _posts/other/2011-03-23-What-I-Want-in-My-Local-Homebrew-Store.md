What I Want in My Local Homebrew Store
======================================

There are few things that can help improve your homebrewing more than having an excellent homebrew shop in your neighborhood. This is using a very generous definition of neighborhood. While there are plenty of [great](http://www.northernbrewer.com/) [homebrew](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/) [shops](http://www.austinhomebrew.com/) [online](http://www.homebrewing.org/), there are certain benefits for being able to visit the shop, interact with the people, stumble upon things you wouldn't otherwise find.

I don't have a crusher at home, and I assume that most homebrewers don't. Most homebrew shops do! There's something perfectly simple about measuring the exact amount of grain you need out of a bin, mixing them all together for your recipe, running them through the crusher and being good to go. There's something maddening about having to buy a 1lb bag of a specialty malt when I only need to a quarter pound and won't be able to brew again for a while. Honestly, it's probably not that big of a deal in dollars and cents to the consumer, but I really do think it's the better way to go.

### New and/or Special Items

These don't fall under the consistent selection heading. A great shop should be able to secure the special release yeasts from White Labs and Wyeast. A great shop should be able to get the special recipe kits. Not every time, but maybe in a rotation have the newer, weirder hops like Citra or Sorachi. Help the homebrewer explore the world of potential out there.

### A Sense of Community

This one is last, but no less important. Homebrewing is all about community. I learn a ton from talking to other homebrewers, trying their beers, having them try mine. Having the folks working at a homebrew shop be friendly and not condescending is so important. There will be people just getting started and people who have been brewing for years, but they're all excited about making beer.

Additionally, I really like the idea of homebrew stores holding classes or having workshops or special guest speakers. Make it almost like a public square for the homebrewing community. Plus, how many homebrewers will walk into your store for an event and not leave with at least some sanitizer or a some priming sugar. If the law allows it, having samples from the kits you sell or recipes you provide is also a great perk that helps spark conversation and build knowledge.
