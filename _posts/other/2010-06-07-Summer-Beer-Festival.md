Summer Beer Festival
====================

I won't be breaking any new ground here, but it's certainly worth a reminder: The Michigan Brewer's Guild Summer Beer Festival takes place July 23rd and 24th in Ypsilanti. The official poster:

Most of Michigan's prominent Microbreweries should be in attendance (the usual suspects such as Grizzly Peak, Founder's, Shorts, and many, many more), providing samples of their flagship beers, as well as some one-time-only special brews.

For those who have never been, it's a great time. Tickets are $30 (Friday) and $35 (Saturday) if purchased in advance at one of the participating breweries. For more info on the Festival, check out the [Michigan Brewer's Guild site](http://www.michiganbrewersguild.org/events.asp). I'll post any updates we receive as the date approaches.
