Batch 1: First Taste
====================

![Our first tast of our first beer](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_yB8ZIqebwqg/SiwRy_aw5SI/AAAAAAAABCg/KBLlCAAczm4/s512/IMG_1310.JPG "The First Beer!")

A week after bottling, it was time to test a beer from the first brewing endeavour. We opened one bottle (there are still about 40 remaining, one of which we'll test for another status update in a week, and one of which we'll probably never open), and poured it into a pint glass, which the three of us shared.

First things first: it was beer! Not rancid wheat-water, but actual pale ale. The physical appearance was about what you'd expect from a pale, but perhaps a little cloudier. There was a satisfying rush of gas when the top was popped. The head of the beer started pretty high, then went down about as you'd expect, with little lattice pattern.

The taste was good. It was still a little bitter, but since we were testing it long before secondary fermentation was complete, it will likely mellow out over the next couple weeks. There was a distinct hop flavor and aroma, though the bitter hop taste was rather biting on first sip, though it did leave a pleasant aftertaste.

Given our depressed expectiations after the slight fiasco that went down during the brewing fiasco, we exceeded our goal. Given a few a weeks it should be a very solid first effort. We can't wait for it to mature.
