Chart Day
=========

Usually we try to have a little more substance to our posts, but I'll "[play between the notes](http://www.guitarmasterclass.net/wiki/index.php/Jimi_Hendrix)" today for a mini post with a couple fun charts. Both come via [I Love Charts](http://ilovecharts.tumblr.com). The first one has made the rounds across the beer blogosphere in the past week or so:

Again, I don't think the chart is perfect. There are a lot of style types missing - but maybe that's a sign we're getting too specific naming styles, no? Still, it's an interesting chart, and though there are omissions, and possibly some incorrect relationships, it speaks to the visual learner in me.

If all those styles make it a bit difficult, the folks at [sloshspot.com](http://www.sloshspot.com/) have put together a handy flow chart. Be prepared to answer some hard questions:

It's mostly the bigger names on there, but it's interesting to go in blind, answer honestly and see where you end up.
