Happy St. Patrick's Day
=======================

As an Irish descendent myself (we Sullivans are like that), I've been known to celebrate St. Patrick's Day quite heartily. I'll probably take it easy today, and watch some NCAA Tournament games... but that doesn't mean I won't start out with a theme drink:

![Jameson's Irish Whiskey](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_2544-824x1024.jpg "Jameson's Irish Whiskey")

Since this is primarily a beer blog, not a liquor blog, take a look at some of our greatest St. Patrick's Day-themed hits:

*   [Beat the Irish Stout.](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2010/09/recipe-beat-the-irish-stout/ "Recipe: Beat the Irish Stout")

*   [S'More's Stout](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2010/10/recipe-s%e2%80%99more-stout/ "Recipe: Sâ€™More Stout") (Irish Stout-based).

*   [Sullivan Stout](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2010/02/recipe-sullivan-birthday-stout/ "Recipe: Sullivan Birthday Stout").

Man, as a stout lover, I'm definitely disappointed we haven't brewed more of them. That'll have to change whenever I get [back on the brewing wagon](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2010/12/ybd-hard-cider/ "YBD Hard Cider")... Of course, it's a great day to drink Guinness, Killian's (if you're into that sort of thing), that substance pictured above, and, if you must, green beer.

Enjoy the day, and be safe.
