Blending Brews
==============

[![Beer blending](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/IMG_7956-300x203.jpg "Beer blending")](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/IMG_7956.jpg)One of the current popular trends in beer drinkg - and brewing by proxy - seems to me to be blending two different (finished) beers to create a distinct third kind. This happens not in the brewing process, or even when kegging, but rather when the beers are poured into a glass to drink.

Some micro-breweries, such as Founder's in Grand Rapids, will give you a blend if you request it, with such concoctions as the "DubMudgeon" (a mix between their [Curmudgeon](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1199/24905) Old Ale and [Double Trouble](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1199/34146) Double IPA). Even some restaurants, not known for their beer, are conjuring up mixes. I've had the "Blasphemy" recommended to me, a mix between Founder's Pale Ale and Bell's Two Hearted IPA. This seems to be hitting the mainstream.

With that in mind, we decided to give it a go for ourselves. We have a number of bottled beers, and Beat the Irish Stout, Pepper Porter 2 (re-named "Couch Fire Ale" in honor of the Michigan State game) and the Boiling Greens DIPA on tap, in addition to a few microbrews, including a number of offerings from Short's Brewing.

The obvious mix is Stout + Porter, because the styles are rather similar, and it would cut the excessive heat from the pepper. The mix is exactly as expected, with a flavor that's mostly just a less-heated version of the pepper porter, with a little bit more body.

The more interesting mix was between Short's Bloody Beer and the Pepper Porter. The concept itself mixes two beers that focus primarily on the non-beer flavors (capsicum for our offering, bloody mary for Short's), and combine them in a proportion that might make the beer flavor reach a whole greater than the sum of its parts.
