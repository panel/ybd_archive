Michigan Liquor Laws a-Changin'?
================================

![Michigan: The Great Beer State?](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_1378-300x200.jpg "The Great Beer State")

Fortunately for denizens of (and visitors to) The Great Beer State, [a new version of the Sunday Sales bill](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=12112537) is close to passing. The 52-page bill includes some of the original provisions - though definitely NOT the culinary school exception - and has Granholm's support. For a mere $160 a year, outlets can now get an extra 5 hours of sale every Sunday morning.

Merchants without liquor licenses or on-premises consumption can also hold tastings (3oz. samples, and no more than three per customer in a given 24-hour period, a specific "tasting license" must be granted by the state), a step in the right direction.

To read the full text, head to [House Bill 6224](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(jlbv2delavbfciabppsripr4))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=2010-HB-6224).
