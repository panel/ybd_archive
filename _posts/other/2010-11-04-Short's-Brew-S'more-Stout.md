Short's Brew S'more Stout
=========================

I was particularly interested in trying this beer because we've brewed a s'more stout of our own, though unfortunately in the days when we weren't so diligent with the blogging. Their recipe is undoubtedly different than our own was (in no small part because it was one of our first few batches, and we didn't quiiiite know what we were doing yet).

While Short's used actual graham crackers and marshmallows in their brew, we went for facsimiles like biscuit malt, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Despite the different processes, the flavor is almost a clone. Cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla, maybe a bit of honey. The body was a little lighter than I'd expect out of the style (I guess "S'more Porter" doesn't quite have the same ring to it), but the color was damn near black.

The differences between their beer and ours come mostly in the clean finish of the professional version, in no small part because we were still working our way through the brewing process at the time we made our s'more stout. However, having a commercially-brewed version of the beer inspired us enough to make a new batch, starting from sratch with the recipe.
