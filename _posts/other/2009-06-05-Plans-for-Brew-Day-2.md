Plans for Brew Day 2
====================

As our first batch of brew finishes fermenting in the bottled stage (we'll sample a bottle tomorrow, as it finishes within the next week or so), it's time to start planning for the second batch. We tentatively plan to brew a wheat beer from a partial-mash kit. We'll buy the kit this afternoon, most likely from The Wine Barrel in Livonia.

More updates (and hopefully more frequent updates of all kinds) as we get this whole "brewing" thing figured out. Suggestions, tips, etc. are all welcome.
