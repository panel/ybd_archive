Brewery Tour: Dogfish Head
==========================

![Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_0528-300x200.jpg "Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron with Palo Santo wood stave")

The Palo Santo Marron is an interesting taste, and the wood-aged qualities are a little distinctive due to the unique wood used. The beer is pictured in front of one of the staves of Palo Santo wood that was cut to create the barrel. Though this piece wasn't used, identical ones compose the enormous barrel seen above. This bad boy was surprisingly heavy, probably around 15 pounds despite only being a couple feet long.
