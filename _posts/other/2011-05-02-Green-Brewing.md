Green Brewing
=============

The University of Michigan's "Out of the Blue" (perhaps best known for boring the daylights out of viewers hoping they'd see sports late at night on the Big Ten Network) [recently tackled a topic near and dear to our hearts](http://www.ootb.tv/episode.php?episode=308&part=2&video=GreenBrewery): beer.

The show produced an 8-minute feature about Michigan student Jarret Diamond, whose Masters thesis revolved around how to make the brewing process more environmentally-friendly. Though inspiration struck at Arbor Brewing, the project centered around Arbor's sister brewery down the road in Ypsilanti, Corner Brewery. Diamond and his team first learned about the commercial brewing process, before figuring out how to improve it.

Other members of Diamond's team focused on improving the sustainability and infrastructure of the brewery. If you're interested in not only beer, but also the environment (as so many beer lovers are), [check it out](http://www.ootb.tv/episode.php?episode=308&part=2&video=GreenBrewery).
