Breweries That Have Made An Impression
======================================

Between having a [Binny's](http://binnys.com) across the street, [Sheffield's](http://www.beermenus.com/cities/chicago/bars/sheffield-s) a five minute walk away and [Local Option](http://www.beermenus.com/cities/chicago/bars/local-option) on my walk home from work, I've been able to really jump into the Chicago beer scene. The selection of beers is very different from what I was used to in Ann Arbor. It's a big market, which can make it desirable for many brewers, but there's a lot of competition.

There have been a handful of breweries that have stood to me since I've moved to Chicago. Some of them I just hadn't seen before and others I'd just passed over for no good reason.

### Lagunitas

I had never heard of Two Brothers before I picked up a six pack of Cane and Ebel ([review](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2010/10/beer-review-two-brothers-cane-ebel/ "Beer Review: Two Brothers Cane & Ebel")). Since then, I've been picking up six packs regularly as they're very reasonably priced and always very good. Not only does Two Brothers, but they also were instrumental in setting up [Windy City Distribution](http://www.windycitydistribution.com/), an independent beer distributor that has played a huge role in getting new and interesting beers into Chicago. Drinking a Two Brothers beer is doing double duty for the craft beer movement!

There isn't a particular beer that stands out, as they have all been really good. Trying Domaine Dupage was a revelation. I normally avoid beers labeled as Farmhouse Ales. For whatever reason, most beers that are termed Farmhouse don't have a compelling flavor profile to me. Domaine Dupage certainly does, though. The most similar, popular beer is probably Fat Tire. It has a really nice, complex malt profile, with just enough hops to keep it from being cloying. It is a very nice, sessionable beer, especially good during the autumn.

Beers I've had: _Cane & Ebel, Ebelsweiss, Northwind Imperial Stout, Bitter End Pale Ale, Domaine Dupage, Long Haul Session._
