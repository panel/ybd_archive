Barely Whining Barley Wine
==========================

Our most ambitious beer we've done, this beer also took us the longest to brew, and has involved the most maintenance while fermenting (no blowoff tube makes life hard...). As we can only fit about 12 lbs of grain in our mash tun, this was a partial mash, with some added liquid malt extract.

### Grain

*   10 lbs 2-Row

*   1 lb 6-Row

*   .5 lb Flaked Barley

*   .5 lb Roasted Barley

### Malt

*   6 lbs Liquid Pale Malt Extract

### Hops

*   2 oz Northern Brewer (11.4% AA) 90 minutes

*   1 oz Cascade (7.4% AA) 10 minutes

### Yeast

*   Wyeast 1098 British Ale Yeast

We mashed for about 2 hours at 160ºF with 4.5 gal of water. We ran the mash through an additional time, then sparged with 170ºF water another 6-7 gallons. We ended up with about 10-11 gallons of liquid in the boil. As we only have a 5 gallon brewpot and 2 other medium sized pots, we spent about 3 hours boiling down the wort. Eventually (after slowly adding more and more of the runoff to the boil, along with the 6 lbs of malt extract) we got it down to right around 5 gallons.

*   OG: 1.119

After this yeast has run it's course, we will add champagne yeast to dry out the beer to dry it out. As it stands, we'll be lucky to get the beer to finish at 10% ABV, with a final gravity around 1.040 (for comparison, our Simple Bitter original gravity was around 1.048).
