Drink Beer, Support Wolverines
==============================

A hearty tip 'o the cap to user James Burrill Angell of [the day job](http://mgoblog.com) for [bringing this to my attention](http://mgoblog.com/mgoboard/drink-beer-michigan-seriously#comment-511931).

Next Saturday the Jolly Pumpkin taphouse in downtown Ann Arbor will be hosting an event to support the Pat Maloy Cancer Scholarship and the UM Club of Greater Detroit's Scholarship fund. Blue Tractor, Jolly Pumpkin, and Grizzly Peak are participating in the event, each pairing food dishes with beers from their breweries.

Guests have the opportunity to vote for their favorite pairings, and the winning restaurant will be awarded the Maize and Blue Cup. Proceeds go to a good cause, so check it out. More details on [the official .pdf](http://www.kines.umich.edu/alumni/beer_tasting.pdf).
