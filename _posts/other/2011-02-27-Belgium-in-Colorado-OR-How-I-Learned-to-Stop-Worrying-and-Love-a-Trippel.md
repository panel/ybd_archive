Belgium in Colorado, OR How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love a Trippel
=========================================================================

[![](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/P2230733-768x1024.jpg "Belgium in Colorado")](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/P2230733.jpg)

Being out in Colorado, without a car, and basically limited to the resort town I live in (Vail) offers many great opportunities to hit the slopes... and not much else. As I've mentioned earlier, most bars here are catered to the generic apres ski crowd, so Bud, Coors, and Keystone (along with New Belgium's Fat Tire) dominate the taps.

The only advantage of living here (Vail Valley specifically), in terms of beer tasting, is the alco-ma-hol stores have a great selection of CO Microbrews, and not just the common ones you see across the country, like NB's Fat Tire, or Avery's The Reverend, I'm talking the entire Odells, Oskar Blues, and New Belgium catalog, and a good chunk of Avery's selection as well. While it does take me a bit of a bus ride to get there, and another one to get back: Worth it.

Today, I gathered a collection of three Belgian-style ales from CO, mostly because it's not a style (or group of styles) that I generally drink, nor is it one of my favorite groups of styles, and getting yourself into a habit of only drinking a couple types of beers is going to diminish your palette, and we can't have that, can we?

And finally, the bomber of Avery's Salvation Belgian golden pale ale: The pour was excellent, with a soft one and a half finger head that subsided to a light dusting of eggshell white foam. Not the retention I was expecting, but the texture was decent, for a non-Belgian-aficionado like myself. The aroma had a sickly sweet fruit aroma, with a small mix of earthy and floral hop notes. It reminded me of our [Lawnmower beers](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2010/06/a-tale-of-two-ales/): a lot going on, but nothing really coherant. I know I'm not well versed in this style, but I don't remember any Belgian anything smell like this. It's hard to get past, maybe because of my bad memories of trying to choke down the Lawnmowers so we could put something else in our kegs...

Once I got it into my mouth, it seemed to normalize a bit, and I was able to track it down a little better, but I'm not sure that's doing it any favors. The spicy pepper notes come through very strongly, drowning out most of the malt flavor. Floral hop flavor also dominates. I caught a bit of honey and maybe a lick of cruciferous veggies, cabbage, mostly. The alcohol covers up any other notes that might lead you to think this was anything but a macabre attempt at a complex, enlightened beer.

Well! What an adventure! That was certainly interesting, and it ran the gamut of Beer I Loved (Tripel), Beer I Liked (Abbey), and Beer I'll Quaff, But Not Do So Enthusiastically (Salvation). Importantly, I reminded myself that some Belgians can rock my socks. It's easy to get caught up in our preferred styles. We always try that IPA we've never had before, or the new stout our beer store is carrying. That's totally fine! That's great! We drink beer because we like it. Certain styles we like more than others, so our tabs _should_ favor those brews. I just want to emphasize the importance of not letting yourself forget what certain aspects you like and dislike about styles you might rarely drink.

Your palette is like a muscle. Exercise it. Challenge it with flavors it doesn't always come across. It will make your ability to discern the various aspects of the beers you usually consume all the more. Maybe you didn't notice that the stout you always pour has a slight but now-noticeable ester presence, or that APA has some tannin notes you never got before. Expand your tongue - stretch it and flex it.
