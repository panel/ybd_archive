Beer Trip: Short's Brewing Company
==================================

Though it hasn't made as many [appearances on these pages](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/tag/shorts-brew/) as I would expect, it's fair to say that all three contributors to  this site are big fans of Short's Brewing. Their beers can be hit-or-miss, sure, but the main thing is this: _they're trying crazy shit_. We're big fans of experimentation in brewing, and there aren't many widely-distributed breweries that are willing to do things like make a bloody mary-themed beer, complete with salty flavor, etc.

So, I've said all this to preface an admission: despite our love for Short's, and numerous experiences drinking their products, none of us has ever made the trip to Northern Michigan to experience Short's in the flesh.

Until now.

Thanks to a wedding in Traverse City, I found myself in the wild North of Michigan, and - as the plus-one of a member of the bridal party - an entire day with nothing to do. It is common sense what Short's is, but I continued to journey on.

### Location

I knew Bellaire was in the middle of nowhere, but man, Bellaire is in the middle of _nowhere_. From Traverse City, there are primary routes to take: along the Grand Traverse Bay, or around the other side of Torch and Elk Lakes to the East.

Regardless, I wasn't going to drive that far North without trying a few brews - albeit a couple I'd had before - so I picked up a flight. The image at right shows (from near to far): 2009 Golden Rule, Alter Spalter, Autumn Ale, Spruce Pils, and The Magician.

The Spruce Pils tastes downright earthy, green, planty... it has the same flavor of the smell of a certain substance. I've had it before, this came as no surprise.

The beer that did surprise me - and again, it's one I'd had before - was The Magician. It's a nice brown ale, with plenty of toffee and caramel tastes in the malt experience. It's lightly hopped - though the Short's menu mentioned that makes it ideal for newcomers to beer (with the implication that it's not good for anyone else), about which I couldn't roll my eyes hard enough.

The other three beers were mostly non-notable. They were good, solid beers, as is expected. Any other week(s) of the year, however, I wouldn't have even bothered ordering them, instead opting for one of the more creative offerings you'd typically see on draft.

### Summary

Short's is known as a good brewery, and making the trip didn't do anything to dissuade me from thinking that. It's in the middle of nowhere, both an annoyance and part of what makes it so special. It's worth making the journey only if you're headed in that direction anyway, but on a standard week with a more creative beer list - and the chance to see a bit of live music 0 it can make for an excellent experience.
