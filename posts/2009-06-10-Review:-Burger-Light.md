Review: Bürger Light
====================

Last night I was watching the hockey game with some friends. We started off drinking Bell's Oberon, which most people in the region know, but being poor college kids/poor college graduates, economics eventually took over.

One of the kids we were with had recently been in Cincinatti, Ohio where he found Bürger Light on sale for $2.99 for a six pack.  Naturally he picked up a few of them to bring back to Michigan.  After a few good beers, we decided our palates were numbed enough to give this beer a go.

We made sure to keep it extra cold. We didn't poor it into a glass because it would not have been worth the water/soap to wash the glass afterward. I cracked mine open and took a sip and didn't really taste much of anything.  I guess water is the most drinkable and refreshing liquid on the Earth, so if those are the qualities desired in the beer, tasting like water is good, right?

There was absolutely nothing remarkable about this beer other than its price, which, especially for Michigan residents used to a higher alcohol tax, seems ludicrously low.  There's a place and time for cheap beer, and if you really want to put the emphasis on cheap, you can't really go wrong with Bürger Light.  I certainly wouldn't drink it as my first, second or third beer of the night, but it's not a horrible option to have just to have something to drink while watching a game.

Bürger Light is available throughout Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana at $2.99 for a six pack and $5.99 for a twelve pack. Here's an [article about it's relaunch](http://www.urbancincy.com/2009/05/burger-beer-back-in-nati.html "UrbanCincy").
