Recipe: Beat the Irish Stout
============================

_Apologies for the lack of posting. We've been bad bloggers._

Second in the Football Series 2010, this Irish Stout serves as the theme beer for Notre Dame (The Fighting Irish) and UMass (the country's largest Irish population per capita). It's based on a modified version of the Sullivan Irish Stout, my 2010 birthday beer. It's a little lower gravity, and hopefully a bit better balance.

Grains

*   8lb Maris Otter

*   1/2lb 120L Crystal Malt

*   1lb Chocolate Malt

*   1lb Black Patent

*   1/4lb Roasted Barley

We had a long mash at about 170, lasting about an hour and a half. Coming out of the mashing tun, our runnings started jet black (and thick), eventually tailing off to dark brown.

Hops

We added hops in several additions, starting at 60 minutes with 2oz of Williamette, then 1/4oz at :45, :30, and :15. After the cold break, we added the final 1/4oz.

Yeast

After cooling to about 90F, we transferred to our carboy, and added Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale Yeast). After a few days, it seemed like it hadn't started, so I bought White Labs WLP004 - which I didn't have to use, because it finally got going on its own.

Tasting Notes

Standard stout. Not strong alcohol or hops flavors. Tastes like we maybe should have tried to ferment it down a little more (still a too-malty flavor). In all, a very good beer, but not our best effort.
