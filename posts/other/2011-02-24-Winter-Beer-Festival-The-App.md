Winter Beer Festival: The App
=============================

If you're attending the [Michigan Brewer's Guild](http://michiganbrewersguild.businesscatalyst.com/) Winter Beer Festival and have a smartphone, boy do we have something exciting for you. Tech guru Paul has put together a web-based application to help you remember the following:

*   Which beers you had.

*   What you thought (on a "liked/didn't like"-type scale, not specifics) of it.

*   Which beers were your favorite.

Perhaps the most useful is that it includes the full beer list, conveniently organized by brewery, so you don't have to rummage around in your pockets for a piece of paper to see which beers are available at each brewery. That piece of paper inevitably ends up tattered beyond recognition by the end of the day, and there's no risk of that happening to your phone.

Without further ado, you can download the app here. It requires registration (free, and no e-mail address acquired, it just helps you keep track of your beers). If your phone is equipped with a QR reader, point it at your computer monitor and snap away here. If not, visit [yeastboundanddown.com/wbf](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/wbf/).

It's still a work in progress, so you can test out the app a bit, and let us know on twitter (@[yeastbounddown](http://twitter.com/yeastbounddown), or there's a link at the bottom of the app) or in the comments here what we need to frantically work on for the next day or so.

If you're interested in just helping test, you can do so from your computer's web browser as well. If you have suggestions, or notice that something is broken, please let us know so Paul can work on fixing it.
