New Holland at Ashleys
======================

I rarely have reason to go out to the bar in Ann Arbor, but when I read that several New Holland beers were going to be featured at Ashley's last night, I couldn't help but check it out. There were about 10 beers on tap, ranging from the ordinary (Poet Stout, which you can pick up at pretty much any grocery store in the state) to the ordinary-but-on-Firkin (Dragon's Milk), to those I'd never seen before (Charkoota Rye).

### Night Tripper

Classic imperial IPA (can an imperial IPA be "classic?"). Nothing really distinct from other beers in the genre. Decent nose/body balance, some graperuit citrus and a lot of bitterness in the flavor.

### Overall

Of course, if I had read a little more carefully before heading out, I would have seen that many of the beers weren't going to be tapped until later in the night, and I wouldn't have shown up at quarter-to-6... since I closed the place down, that's more than 8 hours in the bar. Oops. Good times were certainly had by all.
