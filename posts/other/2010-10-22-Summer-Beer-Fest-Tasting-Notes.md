Summer Beer Fest Tasting Notes
==============================

I'm attending the Harvest Beer Festival tomorrow, so I figured now is as good a time as any to finally get around to publishing our notes from the summer beer fest.

These... these were composed in progressing states of intoxication, with the help of a devoted secretary who unfortunately isn't as well-versed in beer as we are (and may have freelanced on a few notes). Paul, Nate, and I all tasted pretty much every beer listed here. Some of them we didn't provide notes (or only provided drunken mumblings that were beyond transcription), so bear with us.
