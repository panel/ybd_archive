Ann Arbor Beer Updates
======================

Since we're not fully-attuned enough with current events in our (well, now just my) fair city, time for a brief update. First, [from David Bardallis on AnnArbor.com](http://www.annarbor.com/entertainment/food-drink/the-week-in-beer-september-30---october-7/): Beer events Friday (at Jolly Pumpkin), Saturday (at [Arbor Brewing Company](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/tag/arbor-brewing-company/)), and Tuesday (at Corner Brewery in Ypsi and [Grizzly Peak](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/tag/grizzly-peak/)). The GP event sounds particularly interesting:

> Over at [Grizzly Peak](http://grizzlypeak.net/), 120 W. Washington, the monthly **Brewer’s Night** is back. Drop in from 6-9 p.m. for discounted beer samplers, brewery tours personally conducted by brewing demigod **Duncan Williams**, and a taste of something special on cask — in this case, all your correspondent knows is it will be blended and oak-aged.

Very interesting. Click through for more details. Also at Grizzly Peak, you can pick up a commemorative Oktoberfest pint glass for the next two weeks only. Stop in to get the full details.

Elsewhere in town, Wolverine State Brewing isn't open for the drankin' quite yet, but you can [join their mug club](http://www.a2beerwench.com/2010/09/join-club-or-whither-art-thou-mug-club.html) in anticipation of the brewpub license coming through.
