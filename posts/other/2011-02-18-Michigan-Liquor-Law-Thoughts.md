Michigan Liquor Law Thoughts
============================

![Michigan: The Great Beer State?](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_1378-300x200.jpg "The Great Beer State")

I've already posted on [Michigan Liquor Laws](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2010/11/michigan-liquor-laws-a-changin/) once, but I think it's also important to say not only what those laws are, but what I think they should be. I've traveled to many states, and though Michigan is often known as one of the most beer-friendly, that doesn't mean there are some things I'd like to see changed. Shockingly, considering the nature of this site, most of my suggestions involved loosening restrictions.

### Pennsylvania

The Keystone State was founded by Quakers, and it is notorious for its ridiculously restrictive liquor laws. Beer can only be purchased in state-run stores (for now) or to-go restaurants, and anyone who's visited Pennsylvania has been frustrated by the archaic legal restrictions.

That said, there is one thing that I've experienced in Pennsylvania that I'd like to see the State of Michigan adopt: free samples. When I visited Philadelphia in the fall, I went into a beer store (state-run, of course) and was able to try samples of several different beers. In Michigan, you can only give out free samples that are brewed on-premises, or in an establishment owned by the brewer.  The restrictions have eased up slightly since the recent legislation went through, but samples still have to be purchased (though they're now allowed to sell them at pacage liquor outlets).

### Illinois/New York

This is certainly the case in many other states as well, but statutes limiting the closing of bar establishments to 2AM at the latest are an annoyance in Ann Arbor. In Paul's new hometown of Chicago, 4AM is the time du jour, and Nevada (particularly Las Vegas) famously has 24-hour service.  I understand some of the reasons behind this, as it's possible to be a public nuisance, and there's risk of leading to overserving patrons, but aren't there other statutes that already take care of this?

In Ann Arbor, a law passed a couple years back allowing establishments (i.e. nightclubs) to stay open until 4 if they stop serving at 2, but what purpose does that really serve?

### Others?

Beer distributors are a big lobby in every state that has robust alcohol trade, and though there are some positive aspects to this (anybody who's taken Econ 101 knows about natural monopolies), but there are also problems with state-mandated exclusive distributorship.

The biggest problem comes from restricting the availability of certain products in a location. If Distributor X controls Bells distribution in your area, and they don't carry Oberon, for example (oh hai Chicago, until recently), you're out of luck. The lack of Yeungling availability that your friends who are Pennsylvania ex-pats keep bitching about is another example of this - showing that it's not a Michigan-specific problem.

I understand that the strong distributor lobby is going to make this tough to change, but there has to be some way to allow for exemptions that will increase the availability (and therefore sales) of craft beer across the country.
