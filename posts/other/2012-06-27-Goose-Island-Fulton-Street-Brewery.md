Goose Island Fulton Street Brewery
==================================

This weekend I attended an event that was at Goose Island's Fulton Street production brewery. I've been to both of the brewpubs, so this was the last of Goose Island trifecta for me.Â The event was held on the loading dock of the warehouse area. They had Green Line, Matilda, Summertime and 312 on tap. I know for sure the first three were made there. I'm not sure where 312 is produced after the InBev purchase. Anyway, it was a fun event and interesting view of a production brewery.
