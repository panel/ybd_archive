Quick Site Note
===============

So... I just noticed that comments were set to logged in users only. That was an accident that has since been fixed. I certainly feel like an idiot for not making sure comments were open, but I feel less like a pariah due to lack of comments. Everything evens out in the end, I guess.

So, I encourage you to join in the discussion about beer and brewing (hopefully one brave soul will comment first just to verify that I actually fixed it!).

Cheers!
