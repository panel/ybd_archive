So it's been a year since we said "screw it; let's brew!" We've come a long way from our first extract based, pale ale kit that bottled using a length of rubber hosing. Nowadays, we only bottle for special occassions and keg the rest. We go to our LHBS to measure and crush our grain for all grain brewing.

We've had some highs (Oaked Wee Heavy, PSU Old Ale, S'More Stout) and some lows (exploding bottles, a lawnmower beer with an off taste). For our one year anniversary, we decided to get back to our roots.

We looked back to the original kit and came up with an all-grain version of the recipe. Brewing pictures included. The original gravity appears to be around 1.036.
