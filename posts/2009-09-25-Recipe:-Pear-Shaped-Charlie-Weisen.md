Recipe: Pear-Shaped Charlie Weisen
==================================

In keeping with our football themed beer concurrent with the University of Michigan season, for next week, we brewed a 'Weis'-en in honor of the large mass of flesh and cholesterol that is the head coach of Notre Dame. This is our first beer to be put into secondary.
