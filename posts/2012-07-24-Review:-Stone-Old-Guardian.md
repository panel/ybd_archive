Review: Stone Old Guardian
==========================

[Stone](http://www.stonebrew.com/)Â has quite a few canonical beers. Arrogant Bastard is one of the best West Coast beers. Sublimely Self Righteous Ale acted as the model for black IPAs as they rose to ubiquity. Old Guardian is right up there for American Barely Wines.

While I spend a lot of time in this space talking about the joy of creating or trying something surprising and genuinely new, I do appreciate the standards. It doesn't seem like summer without Saison DuPont. Two Hearted isn't exceptional in any way besides being the best widely available IPA in the country. These beers act as guideposts for innovation and change. They are the established base that brewers use for inspiration.

A lot of times, I overlook beers because I see them all over. Sometimes it's worthwhile to give the out there beers a break and go back to the beers that either created or defined styles.

### Tasting Notes

**Appearance**: This beer was not as dark as I expected. The beer is a coppery, tan, with ruby tinges when you hold it up to the light. There was a fluffy, off-white head that faded quickly to a thin film.

**Aroma**: The smell is all malt. Tons of caramel and biscuit comes through. There's a hint of alcohol heat at the back end of the nose. It certainly isn't cloying, but has a bit of sweetness to it.

**Taste**: The taste a bit sharper and drier than the nose. The hops are certainly not overpowering, but come in to help balance the flavor and keep it from being overwhelmingly sweet. At the front of the taste there's plenty of caramel and malt. The hops follow to dry it out a little bit more. At the end of there's a fair bit of alcohol heat. You don't want to have a beer that's 11% not to have a little kick to it.

**Mouthfeel**: It's not as viscous as I thought it would be. There's not much carbonation; just enough to keep it a little lively. It could actually use a bit more carbonation to keep it from being a bit syrupy. Still, that's not necessarily against style for a Barley Wine.

**Overall**: I'm not exactly sure if this is the perfect beer for a 80 degree night with about 90% humidity, but this is certainly a good beer. I had this "cellaring" for about 6 months before cracking it open. That's really nothing for this beer. I'd be curious to try it after sitting for a year or two. This is certainly a great example of a Barley Wine. There's a little bit of that Stone, West coast style with the somewhat aggressive hopping, but I think that helps balance it out, rather than move it out of style.
