Back in the Saddle
==================

It's been a while since I have brewed. Between [Tim's stove issue](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2010/12/ybd-hard-cider/) and my moving to Chicago, I haven't been able to make any beer since October. That didn't stop us from putting together a mead and a cider, but those really just aren't the same.

Well, that all changed this Saturday. A friend of mine received a really well put together homebrewing kit for Chistmans/birthday. The kit was from [Michigan Brewing Company's](http://www.michiganbrewing.com/) homebrew shop called Things Beer and really just had everything, including a propane burner and 7.5gal brew pot. He also received an extract Two Hearted clone recipe kit.

We decided that this Friday was going to be the day. We got started around 2 and finished up right about 7. I had never used a propane burner before, and wow, is it a lot nicer than having to wait 90minutes to get the water up to the strike temperature. If we had a wort chiller, we probably could have been done by about 5:45-6pm.

I've picked up most of the supplies for a 10gal mash tun, and we're going to hopefully have our second brew day next weekend. Given that we have an IPA fermenting, I was thinking either brewing a batch of the [Joe Paterno is Old Ale](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2009/12/recipe-joe-paterno-is-olde-ale/) or the [Oak'd Wee Heavy](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2010/08/oakd-wee-heavy-recipe/), both in my top 5 beers I've made.

In YB&D form, I made sure this day was documented:
