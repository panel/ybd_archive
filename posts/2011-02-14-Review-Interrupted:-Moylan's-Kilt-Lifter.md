Review, Interrupted: Moylan's Kilt-Lifter
=========================================

I've been known to love a good scotch ale or two. In fact, it may be my favorite style. Unfortunately, that means when I have one that's not quite right, it bothers me more than it might most beer drinkers. Alas, that was the case when I recently tried Moylan's Kilt Lifter.

The first thing I noticed when pouring the beer is that there wasn't much carbonation. In fact, it was dead flat. The picture at right was taken mere seconds after pouring from bottle to stein, and there are no bubbles (Paul and Nate will be the first to tell you that I'm typically a violent pour, as well).Â I've never had a commercially-distributed beer that was dead flat, so I'm left to wonder, among other things, how long it had sat on the shelf.

Though I did drink the entire bomber (who am I to turn down beer, spoiled though it may be?), I'm hesitant to review it, because my thoughts are tainted by the dysfunctional ale. The aroma and taste were both near what you'd expect from a scotch ale, with a lot of malt and some peaty notes. However, I'll have to pick up another bottle of this particular beer in order to give it a fair review.
