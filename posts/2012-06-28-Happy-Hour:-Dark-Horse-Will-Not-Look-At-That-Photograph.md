### Darkhorse And Nickleback?

So… a couple years ago [Nickleback](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDgs1iroYyY) or some representative approached [Dark Horse Brewery](http://www.darkhorsebrewery.com/content.asp?PageName=Index) about [some sort of promotional agreement](http://www.darkhorsebrewery.com/content.asp?PageName=Blog). Apparently, Nickleback's sixth studio albums (srlsy? they have six?!) is called Dark Horse. Some marketing intern probably got a synergy stiffy and sent off an email. Dark Horse's marketing director asked what they should do in the blog post linked above. The owner of Dark Horse, Alan Morse, stepped in and made the executive decision to decline the offer because [Nickleback is "shit rock."](http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2012/06/michigan_brewery_turning_down.html)

This story got posted up on Reddit on Wednesday and blew up Twitter. As Michigan Brewing Company has taught us, hitching your wagon to mediocre musicians is not a good long term solution. That and you should probably pay your bills every once in a while…

### Zymurgy's Best Beers in America

\[caption id="attachment\_1211" align="alignleft" width="225"\][![Pliny the Elder](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pliny-225x300.jpeg "pliny")](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pliny.jpeg) Four-peat\[/caption\]

Zymurgy, the magazine run by the American Homebrewers Association, released the [results of its 2012 Best Beers in America survey](http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/pages/community/news/show?title=2012-best-beers-in-america). Pliny the Elder gets the four-peat. I got to taste about 2oz of Pliny at a tailgate this past fall. It was very, very good, but I think the relative difficulty of acquiring it has raised its profile higher than the beer itself. Two Hearted is the first runner up. I've written about this previously,  but Two Hearted is a damn good beer that I always overlook because I can always get it. The reverse Pliny, if you will.

Eight of the top ten are some form of IPA[1](#1). Thirty-two of the top fifty are between pale ales and hop-bombs. Tim and Nate make fun of me for always getting hoppy beers, but I'm not even this focused. Four Michigan beers made the list, Two Hearted, Hopslam (4th), Founders Breakfast Stout (23rd) and KBS (T37th lolwut?). Bell's and Founders both rank in the top ten breweries at 5th and 10th respectively.

This may eventually be a full post in the future, but I'm not sure I quite agree with these choice.
