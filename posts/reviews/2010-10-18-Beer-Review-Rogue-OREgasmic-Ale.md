================================

This is the first Grow Your Own (GYO) beer I've seen from Rogue. Every ingredient comes from their farm in Oregon. In fact, they proudly list their ingredients on their site:

> Brewed using 100% OREGON Ingredients. Micro Barley Farm first growth Dare™ & Risk™ Malts; Willamette, Sterling, and First Growth Micro Hopyard Revolution Hops, Pacman Yeast and Free Range Coastal Water.

I can appreciate the fully integrated approach. It reminds me of the now Colorado based Leopold Brother's Brewery and Distillery. They were a completely carbon neutral, certified green distillery, brewery and greenhouse. So, going back to my granola munching, Ann Arbor roots, lets give this a try.

Rogue describes it as:

> Orange-amber in color, malty aroma, spicy fruity hop flavor with solid malt background and lingering finish.

It poured reddish, orange with a thick, creamy head that was about 2 fingers thick. It slowly laced away but a bit is still on top a few minutes after I poured. The aroma is almost all the malt profile with a bit of the spicy hops. The mouthfeel is amazingly smooth and creamy. The taste is nice, liquidy hops with a bit of with spice afterward. Some of the malt sweetness, character comes through, but it's mainly the hops.

I'm curious to see where this vertically integrated experiment will go. It follows the movement of a lot of chefs getting more into the origins of their foods. Once there are multiple breweries doing this same integration, we can compare and contrast the different origins and their subtle variations.
