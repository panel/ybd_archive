Beer Review: Avery The Kaiser
=============================

I had just gotten my first graduate school exam back, and I got a pretty good grade. I decided this was a moment to celebrate, so I stopped at [Binny's](http://binnys.com "Binny's Beverage Depot") to pick up celebration supplies. As I was perusing the aisles, The Kaiser caught my eye (largely because it was on sale for $5.99!). I, for some reason, tend to skip over Avery beers while buying bottles. I think it's mainly because of the label art, which may be one of the stupidest possible reasons, but there it is.

Anyway, I really liked the concept of an Imperial Oktoberfest, especially on one of the early, cool nights in October. I also really liked The Kaiser as a name for an Imperial Oktoberfest. [Avery Brewing](http://www.averybrewing.com/ "Avery Brewing") describes it:

> The Kaiser once said, "Give me a woman who loves beer and I will conquer the world." If the Kaiser and his significant other had tipped this bottle, we'd all be "sprechenden Deutsch!" We took all that is good in a traditional Oktoberfest - gorgeous, deep copper sheen, massive malty backbone and spicy, floral, pungent noble hops - then intensified each into this, an Imperial Oktoberfest.

My tasting notes:

Appearance: Extremely clear copper with a very thin, cream colored head that dissipated quickly.

Aroma: Dominated by molasses with caramel notes and a bit of pumpkin.

Taste: Tons of malt. Caramel in the beginning flowing into a vegetal, pumpkin flavor with warming phenolic notes at the end.

Mouthfeel: Coating and chewy.

Overall: Perfect for a cool night when I only want a beer a two. The alcohol will keep me warm, and the complexity of the malt flavor keeps it interesting. Also, I enjoy tasting a lager that has this heavy of a mouthfeel. It doesn't happen all the time.
