Beer Review: Kuhnhenn DRIPA
===========================

With Ashley's Ann Arbor conveniently located within walking distance, I get a chance to sample a variety of beers from "Michigan's Premier Multi-tap." The latest I tried comes from a Michigan brewery, in Warren's own Kuhnhenn.

The "Double Rice IPA" is a style I'd never heard of, so of course I had to give it a try.

It looks like a light amber ale, with a clear body. It has a light mouthfeel, but not dry. It is mostly like a conventional IPA. As you can see in the image, the head (which didn't linger) leaves a nice lattice on the glass.

The taste is really sweet - both the malt body (I assume mostly rice) and hops. Rice is a typically flavorless adjunct, so it's no surprise that it doesn't add much flavor outside of sweetness.Â The hops are really juicy/sweet tasting, rather than the typical bitterness you'd expect from an IPA.

As a new style, it's interesting to try, but not really that novel, nor is it something I'd go out of my way to drink again.
