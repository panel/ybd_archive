The special events throughout the week include Monday beer trivia at Ashley's, Tuesday discounts at all participating bars (the above plus Alley Bar) if you wear a Michigan beer t-shirt, Bar Golf on Wednesday, and an American Craft Beer Celebration at Arbor on Thursday. This week is the kick-off for Arbor's 15th Anniversary Weekend, so check out [their website](http://www.arborbrewing.com) for ticket info and further details. More on the Anniversary Weekend (including details on the street party on Friday) later in the week.

This is a very odd lineup, especially for a "beer week" event. Blue Leprechaun and Tio's, in particular, are not exactly beer bars, and the rest are questionable inclusions to varying degrees. It would have been nice to see some other legit beer bars and microbreweries (Blue Tractor, Grizzly Peak, Jolly Pumpkin) on the roster.
