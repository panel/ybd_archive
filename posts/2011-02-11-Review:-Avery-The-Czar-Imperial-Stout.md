Review: Avery The Czar Imperial Stout
=====================================

I'm bunkered down in my apartment during Snowprah Winfrey 2011. Like any good northern kid, I have my supplies ready for a blizzard. I had a choice between a barley wine, imperial stout and imperial black ale. It's a big storm, so I decided to go with the biggest beer in my fridge, Avery Brewing Co.'s The Czar Imperial Stout.

I've tried two other bombers from Avery Brewing Co. The Kaiser was very good and made me think, "I should really try more beers from Avery." Then I tried The Reverend, which made me think, "Maybe I should slow my Avery roll..." The Czar will serve as the great tie breaker.

The company itself describes the beer:

> Behold the stunning crimson hues through the inky blackness. Inhale the noble Hallertau hops, spicy and floral. Savor the flavors redolent of English toffee, rich mocha, sweet molasses, candied currants and a hint of anise. We highly recommend cellaring additional bottles, as the Czar will continue to mature and become denser and more complex with age.

This is the perfect night for an imperial stout, and I might get to work from home tomorrow, so I'm in a good mood to try this. Here's hoping that Avery can win this round!

Appearance: The beer pours dark, opaque brown with a couple ruby flashes if the light hits it the right way. There was a huge, fluffy caramel head that laced down quickly. A thin layer of foam is fighting the good fight still now.

Aroma: I'm getting a roasty, malty sweetness, almost syrupy. There's also a stone fruit and slightly spicy note underneath the sweetness.

Taste: A surprising amount of hop bitterness on the initial taste.  Lots of acrid, roasty notes early in taste. In the middle, there is a nice caramel/toffee sweetness. It finished with some spicy hop notes and warming alcohol taste.

Mouthfeel: Thick, chewy and syrupy. There's not a lot of carbonation, but there's enough to keep it from being completely overwhelming. It coats the mouth and leaves a pleasant lingering alcohol tingling.

Overall: This is a very easy drinking giant beer. It has a lovely, complicated flavor that warms the body and perfectly compliments this ridiculously horrible night. Avery wins this round and is sitting at 2-1.
