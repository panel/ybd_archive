Obama, Brewer?
==============

Regardless of which team you support, the Super Bowl always brings some positive moments (even if it's just a great commercial) and some not-so-great ones (Woodson. Collarbone. Sadface).

This year, one of my favorite stories came out before the Big Game itself. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States... _Homebrewer?_ From Obama Foodorama - which is apparently a blog all about food news from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - comes the news that The Leader of the Free World and his wife [have taken up the hobby](http://obamafoodorama.blogspot.com/2011/02/president-first-lady-host-white-house.html):

> President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama have joined the home brewing beer trend that's swept the US, and will be serving a very special White House brew tonight when they welcome guests for the annual Super Bowl party, to watch as the Packers take on the Steelers.

...But not so fast my friends. Lest you worry that President Obama is more concerned with Alpha Acids and Original Gravities than Egypt and Healthcare, he's not crafting the Ales himself:

> In a special turn of events in the history of White House food creations, one of the White House chefs has brewed White House Honey Ale, a White House aide exclusively tipped ObFo... The President, First Lady, and their guests will be sampling the special suds for the first time this evening. And the Obamas paid for the micro-brewing equipment, the aide noted, so there's no impact on the national debt.

I never thought the "home" in "homebrewing" would mean one of the world's most famous residences, even if the POTUS himself is not the brewer. I wonder if it's a little too early to get some reviews of the beer from Obama's guests.

Homebrewing Guru Charlie Papazian chimes in on the news, saying George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were known to brew, but [probably never in the White House](http://www.examiner.com/beer-in-national/white-house-serves-up-own-homebrewed-white-house-honey-ale).

Hmm... sounds like a topic for future research.
