Obama, Brewer?

...But not so fast my friends. Lest you worry that President Obama is more concerned with Alpha Acids and Original Gravities than Egypt and Healthcare, he's not crafting the Ales himself:

> In a special turn of events in the history of White House food creations, one of the White House chefs has brewedÂ White House Honey Ale, a White House aide exclusively tipped ObFo... The President, First Lady, and their guests will be sampling the special suds for the first time this evening. And the Obamas paid for the micro-brewing equipment, the aide noted, so there's no impact on the national debt.

I never thought the "home" in "homebrewing" would mean one of the world's most famous residences, even if the POTUS himself is not the brewer. I wonder if it's a little too early to get some reviews of the beer from Obama's guests.

Homebrewing Guru Charlie Papazian chimes in on the news, saying George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were known to brew, but [probably never in the White House](http://www.examiner.com/beer-in-national/white-house-serves-up-own-homebrewed-white-house-honey-ale).

Hmm... sounds like a topic for future research.
