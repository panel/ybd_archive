Recipe: Sweet Potato Spiced Ale
===============================

We thought of this beer right around the time we started brewing. We didn't know exactly how to go about it, but we really wanted to do it and have it done for Thanksgiving. Thanks to some ideas from our friends at the [local brewer's guild](http://aabg.org "Ann Arbor Brewer's Guild") and poking around [online](http://homebrewtalk.com "Homebrew Talk"), we came up with a recipe that worked pretty well. The base was the [Great Pumpkin Ale](http://www.homebrewing.org/The-Great-Pumpkin-Charlie-Brown-Ale_p_593.html) from [Adventures in Homebrewing](http://homebrewing.org "Adventures in Homebrewing"). We did mess up and accidentally used a pound of roasted barley instead of the chocolate rye, but it was still delicious.

### Mash

*   2.5lbs 2-row barley

*   ≈2lbs sweet potato

### Boil

*   1lb Roasted Barley (steeped)

*   5lbs light liquid malt extract

*   1oz Centennial Hops (9.0% A.A.) 60 min

*   1tsp Irish Moss 15 min

*   .5oz pumpkin spice 15 min

### Yeast

*   Dry Nottingham strain

We baked the sweet potatoes whole for about an hour at 425ºF, cut them open and scraped them out with a fork. The sweet potato clogged the valve quite a bit and it was quite the pain in the ass.  The running were really golden orange, and if we were to do this in the future, we'd probably go lighter so that sweet potato color could shine through more.
