Recipe: Impromptu Black IPA
===========================

Tim, Nathan and I have been in different states since the Fall of 2010. Predictably, we haven't had a ton of opportunities to get together and brew. One week in May, I was working remotely, Tim's significant was out of town studying and Tim could take a day off to work from home. So a brew day was born.

We met up in Ann Arbor at Ashley's after I drove in from Chicago. After we left the bar, we decided to go to [Adventures in Homebrewing's](http://homebrewing.org) new Ann Arbor location. I had a recipe for a Belgian Strong Golden Ale that I put together a little bit ago that we put together. Then we decided, why not make two beers? So we did a sort of off the cuff Black IPA1.

It was fun exploring the new store and putting together an ingredients kit just like the old days. It actually turned out to be a pretty solid recipe despite the fact we were going on feel more than math.
