Recipe: BREWConn Blueberry Wheat
================================

The first in our Michigan Football 2010 series, BREWConn is a standard summer wheat ale, with 2 quarts of blueberries (about 4 pounds) added in secondary. This was our first extract brew in a while, though it did include some specialty grains.

### Sugars

*   8lb Liquid Wheat Extract

*   .5lb Flaked Wheat (steeped)

*   .5lb Flaked Oats (steeped)

### Hops

*   1/4oz Columbus pellets, added at 60 and 15.

### Yeast

Wyeast 1056.

### Secondary

The beer ended up being much darker in color than we were expecting as we took it out of primary. We bought 2 quarts of locally-grown blueberries, pureed them in a blender, and added it to our secondary fermenter before siphoning the beer into secondary.

### Tasting Notes

Decent. Originally had a yeast-y taste that has gone away the longer we've let it age. Of course, one of the reasons we made this beer for UConn was to hope for a blue color... and we ended up with a red/maroon by the time the blueberries were pureed. That's life, I guess.
