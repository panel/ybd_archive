My temporary lack of a stove has made brewing downright impossible, but the desire for fermentation acknowledges no such obstacles, so while I wait for a replacement, it's time to make a hard cider. The recipe is quite simple indeed:

*   5 Gallons unpasteurized apple cider.

*   1 vial White Labs Irish Ale Yeast (WLP004).

The cider, bought from a local grocery store (and produced by a local orchard) cost short of 20 bucks, and the yeast was a leftover from a changed recipe of beer. Ah, an economically efficient stand-in for homebrew while the brewery is out of commission.

Originally, the cider went an uncomfortable amount of time without starting fermentation, which I thought may have been due to the yeast dying after a couple months in the fridge. However, it got going a few days later, and the delay was more likely due to cold temperatures in my fermentation cellar (a phrase which here means "closet"). It's been bubbling for a little while now.

This was a fairly simple recipe, but once fermentation is complete, the option remains to add spices or other flavors if it lacks a certain something we desire.
