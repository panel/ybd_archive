Review: Stone More Brown Than Black IPA
=======================================

[Previously](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2012/07/review-clown-shoes-hoppy-feet/ "Review: Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet"), I had mentioned that I thought Black IPAs were getting too widespread. It seemed like every brewery [at the festival Nate and I went to](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2012/06/brooklyn-waterfront-beer-festival/ "Brooklyn Waterfront Beer Festival") had 2 of either an IPA, IIPA, DIPA, BIPA or DIPA. I admit, after that festival and after that beer, I was pretty down on Black IPAs. I was just overloaded.

After about a month of having an eclectic mix of beers, I am ready to dive back in a give it a go. It doesn't hurt that Stone makes, what I consider, the ideal [Black IPA](http://www.stonebrew.com/sublimely/). I should mention that I picked this beer up while picking some items up at Whole Foods. I never really consider going there to pick up beers as their a grocery store (a rather pricey one at that), and I have a booze superstore 2 blocks away.

However, I'm a firm believer that one should always take a quick detour through a store's craft beer section. If you go to the same store all the time, you only get the beers picked out by one purchaser and delivered by those distributors. Even if the new store is not an amazing bottle shop, there's a decent chance you might find something interesting that you've never tried before, like this Stone Collaboration beer from 2011.

_More Brown Than Black IPA_ is a collaboration between Stone, [The Alchemist](http://www.alchemistbeer.com/) and [Ninkasi](http://www.ninkasibrewing.com/). The brewers came together after Hurricane Irene hit Vermont and essentially destroyed The Alchemist brewpub. In this video on Stone's youtube channel,Â John Kimmich talks about walking into his bar and brewery and seeing the discussion. They also talk about the beer:

The proceeds of this beer go to a worthy cause; now I just hope the beer is worthy!

### Tasting Notes

**Appearance**: The beer is a dark, opaque brown. There are ruby sparks at the thin parts on the glass, but very little lights gets through. There was a of finger, bubbly white head that laced down the glass to a thin film over the top of the beer.

**Aroma**: There's definitely hop notes in the nose. I'd say mostly resiny with spicy and floral notes. Underneath the hop aroma, really holding it up, is a rich, caramel-y malt smell. This is what these new style, dark IPAs should smell like.

**Taste**: There's a lot of bitterness in this beer, and it really lingers after the sip. I wouldn't call it muddy or messy, but it's trending that way. After the initial taste of hops, the malts come into the taste. They are sweet, roasty with hints of caramel, and really balance with the hops and round out the beer. The sip finishes with some aggressive, lingering bitterness that is tempered and cleaned up by the sweetness of the malt and the bubbles from the carbonation.

**Mouthfeel**: This is a very rich, smooth beer. It doesn't have the dryness one normally associates with an IPA or, even, a Black IPA. It feels like a rich brown ale. The head on top contributes to this feel as well.

**Overall**: I really like this beer. For my money, Stone has the best Black IPA out there, and this is a worthy sibling. The fact that a slice goes to charity is purely a bonus. Hopefully something like this beer makes it into production at Stone. This is what needs to happen in Dark IPAs.
