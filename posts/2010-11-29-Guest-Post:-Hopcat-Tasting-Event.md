Guest Post: Hopcat Tasting Event
================================

Special thanks to Geoff of [The Hoover Street Rag](http://hooverstreetrag.blogspot.com/) for this guest post. Geoff took in a tasting event at Hopcat in Grand Rapids, and was kind enough to pass along notes.

**Shorts Huma Lupa Licious**

IPA - Pint glass.

Love the Huma. Always a favorite of mine.  And $6 for a pint plus the house burger and crack fries is a fantastic bargain.  The first taste is of crashing hops bitterness with citrus.  It mellows briefly  before a second wave hits, then the long finish.

**Hopcat Kodial Killer**

American Barleywine - Tulip glass

Dark, near-black appearance with an aroma of whisky and dark fruits.  Drink slowly to keep from being overwhelmed by the alcohol and pronounced fruit notes and ruining the flavor, which is refined by aging for four months in spend Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout barrels.

**Shorts Bourbon Barrel Huma Lupa Licious**

IPA - Globe-shaped sampler glass

I wanted to be able to directly compare the bourbon barrel version to the standard, and it's almost unnecessary.  The whisky smell is huge off of it, obscuring the grapefruit notes of the original, and the bourbon taste is even bigger, almost obliterating the regular Huma, though it's there underneath everything.  I'll defer to the Hopcat description: "Think creamy vanilla-laced hop cones, soaked in bourbon."

**Shorts Bourbon Barrel Sustenance**

Schwartzbier - Tulip

Oh, this is delicious.  Full of the toasty schwartzbier maltiness with the bourbon coming in around the edges.  I could drink this all night

**Goose Island Bourbon County Stout**

Globe-shaped sampler glass

I had the Bourbon County Stout before, in a 4-pack of 12-ounce bottles, and it was something of a disappointment.  I'd had the Founders KBS before (on tap at the brewery) and hoped that Goose Island would be able to compete with that.  What I tasted was very good, but not in the same class as the KBS.  I'm extremely happy to report that I was totally off base on that.  On tap, Bourbon County Stout is a revelation.  It's huge, thick; viscous as motor oil and full of chocolate, bourbon, and coffee.  The clear winner on the night.  I still prefer the KBS overall (I think the flavors are a little more complex), but this is ever so close.

**Dark Horse Plead the 5th**

Russian Imperial Stout - Globe-shaped sampler glass

The lightest RIS I've ever encountered.  It pours brown and translucent with no real head by the time it was served.  A whiff of alcohol on the nose, not much more in terms of scent, it has a smooth mouthfeel with tastes of dark chocolate and a strong whisky finish.

**Goose Island Imperial Brown Goose**

Old Ale - Globe-shaped sampler glass

Pours dark brown with a persistent, thin off-white head.  Goose Island blended their 2004 and 2005 Christmas ales and aged them in 4-year-old Jim Beam and 12-year-old Heaven Hill bourbon barrels, and I can detect cinnamon and nutmeg among other spices alongside a mellow bourbon flavor.

**Great Divide Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout**

Russian Imperial Stout - Globe-shaped sampler glass

It smells like a beer, but tastes STRONGLY of charcoal smoke.  Must be the oak chips it's been aged with, giving it a burnt flavor that lingers for a long time after the vanilla flavors fade away.

**Avery Samael's Ale**

English Barleywine - Globe-shaped sampler glass

It tastes sweet and light, but packs a 14.5% ABV wallop and finishes with cinnamon and nutmeg.

**Founders Backwoods Bastard**

We Heavy Scotch Ale - Globe-shaped sampler glass

You can taste the Dirty Bastard under it all, but to me it tastes more like Devil Dancer than anything else.  It has that same way about it where it hits like a sledgehammer and lingers.

**Founders Black Biscuit**

Old Ale - Tulip glass

The pour overflowed the glass on the way over and now my hands smell like beer and chocolate.  Black Biscuit has a thin but persistently full head and pours thick and black.  This is a black old ale aged in bourbon barrels, and the chocolate, bourbon, and roasted malt flavors dominate.  It's not quite as huge or complex as a bourbon stout, but the tradeoff is that it's more drinkable.  Definitely give this one a try if you have the chance.

**Atwater Barrel Aged Cherry Stout Firkin**

Stout - Globe-shaped sampler glass

Tastes like black cherries soaked in bourbon and dropped into a stout, but not overpowering the stout base.  I'm not a big fan of fruit beers, but I can see myself ordering this as a a full pour.
