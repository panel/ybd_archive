Review: Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet
==============================

I remember when I first heard of Black IPAs. There were posts trying to figure out what to call this new style. Is it a Black IPA? A Robust Porter? Cascadian Dark Ale? The industry seems to have settled on Black IPA, and they've started becoming fairly commonplace.

I remember the first BIPA I tried. I was at my go to bar, with my go to server (who has since changed jobs) looking down the draft list. I asked him if there was anything exciting, and he just nodded and started pouring me [Stone Sublimely Self Righteous Ale](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/147/38470). I'm not sure if that was the first major BIPA, but I know it certainly was a lot of people's first BIPA. There are moments quaffing beer that are special, when you try something that you haven't tasted before. That was one of those moments.

I continued to keep a look out for BIPAs and picked them up at bottle shops or ordered them at the bar when I found them. But after a while, more and more started showing up. Some of them still blow me away, but the hit rate seems to have gone down, and I tend to look for other styles.

**Appearance**: The beer pours a very, dark copper, with very little translucence. Holding up it the light, you get some flashes of ruby. There was a one finger, creamy head that receded quickly down to about half a finger and remained there.

**Aroma**: The aroma is a mix of a spicy hops with a strong caramel note from the malt base. The nose is incredibly well balanced.

**Taste**: Unfortunately, the taste isn't as well balanced as the nose. The first flavor is a muted malt taste, that is immediately followed by an intense bitterness that mixes with alcohol heat and some acridity from the dark malts. The after taste is a lingering, coating bitterness that stays on my tongue.

**Mouthfeel**: The beer is very smooth with a slightly heavy body for an IPA. There's a bit of carbonation from the bomber, but nothing too effervescent.

**Overall**: Maybe I've just been in a [BIPA](http://yeastboundanddown.com/2012/07/recipe-impromptu-black-ipa/ ‎) [overload](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2012/06/brooklyn-waterfront-beer-festival), but this beer doesn't really do much for me. The bitterness overpowers the malt flavors that I want, yet manages to accentuate the acridity that I would want to hide. Also, while I enjoy hoppy beers, I don't care for the lingering and sometimes muddy bitterness in a lot of IPAs. The best hop bombs, Firestone Walker Double Jack and Bell's Hopslam (short list, and strictly my opinion), have a great hop nose with a deceptively strong malt backbone to stand up to the hops. The bitterness also is cleaner, with more flavor, be it citrus, spice, earthiness, grassiness, rather than just unplaceable bitterness.
