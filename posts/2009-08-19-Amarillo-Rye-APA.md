Amarillo Rye APA
================

We haven't really done a big, in your face, hoppy beer. This beer will hopefully remedy that. We were inspired by the Western Michigan vs. Michigan football game to go for something that seems 'western'. Amarillo is a West Coast hop and rye seemed like a good, olde time addition.

We did our first partial mash for this recipe. I don't think we got very good efficiency, but that will only help with the hop utilization and cut down on some of the alcohol.

_We were unable to take an initial gravity due to 'equipment failure', i.e. we melted our tube we used for measuring it, so your guess is as good as ours as to the actual efficiency we got unless someone offers to run it through a GC-mass spec._

### Mash:

*   2lbs American 6 Row Barley

*   2lbs Malted Rye

*   1lb American Crystal 10L

*   1/2lb American Victory

### Boil:

*   60 Minutes
    
    *   3lbs Pale Liquid Malt Extract
    
    *   1oz Amarillo Hops (8.6% AA)
    

*   45 Minutes
    
    *   1oz Amarillo Hops (8.6% AA)
    

*   30 Minutes
    
    *   1oz Amarillo Hops (8.6% AA)
    

*   15 Minutes
    
    *   4lbs Pale Liquid Malt Extract
    
    *   1/2oz Amarillo Hops (8.6% AA)
    
    *   1tsp Irish Moss
    

*   Flameout
    
    *   1/2oz Amarillo Hops (8.6% AA)
    

### Yeast

We were actually planning on going with White Labs California Ale Yeast (WLP001), but in our haste/obliviousness we ended up with California V Ale Yeast (WLP051). I actually think it might work better for the beer we're going for. WLP001 ferments really cleanly and lets all the ingredients provide the flavors. WLP051 still ferments cleanly, but provides fruity/citrus notes that will hopefully work well with citrusy Amarillo hops.

### Fermentation

We filled our carboy up to about 5.5 gallons and threw it in the closet. It started fermenting by the morning (roughly 7hours, could have been less though).Â  It smells really hoppy and citrusy. It's been fermenting for about 5 days now and is still bubbling multiple times a minute. It will probably stay in the carboy for another week or so before we bottle.
