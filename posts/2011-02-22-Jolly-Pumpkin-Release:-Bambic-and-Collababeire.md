Living in a great craft beer city often provides the opportunity to take part in cool events, and recently just such an event took place at Jolly Pumpkin in Ann Arbor. A couple weeks ago, the taphouse had a release for two creations from their Dexter brewery, Collababeire and Bambic.

The release itself was hectic, with patrons lined up to purchase bottles of each beer (some of them trying to game the system to get more than the maximum - which, uncool, dude). In no hurry, I grabbed a seat at the bar, and although it took a while to be served, it certainly beat out waiting in line to not even drink the brews immediately.

Collababeire, as the name implies, is a collaboration between Jolly Pumpkin and a couple other breweries. Stone in California and Nogne Ø from Norway were involved in the creation of this farmhouse-style ale. The three have collaborated [twice](http://beernews.org/2008/11/stone-special-holiday-ale-jolly-pumpkin-nogne-o/) [before](http://beernews.org/2009/11/nogne-o-islay-winter-ale-highland-imperial-stout-imperial-dunkelwit/), and this was the third leg of that relationship. Each brewery created their own beer from the same recipe, and they were blended in Dexter and aged in oak. This is a "holiday ale," although, as you may note, it was released well after the holidays.

Bambic is Jolly Pumpkin's Bam Biere blended with their Lambicus Dexterius (yeah, I didn't even notice until writing this post that the title referred to "lambic." I'm slow). The label says "Winking Lizard" all over it, so one must assume this beer was created primarily for [Winking Lizard Tavern](http://www.winkinglizard.com/), a chain across the state of Ohio (further research shows it's to celebrate [WL's 25th anniversary](http://beernews.org/2010/12/bambic-jolly-pumpkin-crafts-new-beer-for-winking-lizards-25th/)).

I won't talk too much about how they tasted here, but there will be full reviews coming soon. I picked up a 330mL bottle of the Bambic and a 750mL bottle of the Collababeire, so I'll let Paul take place in the tasting before putting official thoughts to paper.
