==============================================

Bambic is Jolly Pumpkin's Bam Biere blended with their Lambicus Dexterius (yeah, I didn't even notice until writing this post that the title referred to "lambic." I'm slow). The label says "Winking Lizard" all over it, so one must assume this beer was created primarily for [Winking Lizard Tavern](http://www.winkinglizard.com/), a chain across the state of Ohio (further research shows it's to celebrate [WL's 25th anniversary](http://beernews.org/2010/12/bambic-jolly-pumpkin-crafts-new-beer-for-winking-lizards-25th/)).

I won't talk too much about how they tasted here, but there will be full reviews coming soon. I picked up a 330mL bottle of the Bambic and a 750mL bottle of the Collababeire, so I'll let Paul take place in the tasting before putting official thoughts to paper.
