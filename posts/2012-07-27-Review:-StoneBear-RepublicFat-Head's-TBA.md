Review: Stone/Bear Republic/Fat Head's TBA
==========================================

We've made a [few](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2010/08/chili-pepper-beer-recipe/ "Chili Pepper Beer Recipe") [crazy](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2009/06/peanut-butter-porter-recipe/ "Peanut Butter Porter Recipe") [beers](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2010/10/recipe-s%e2%80%99more-stout/ "Recipe: S’More Stout") in our brief time as brewers. They're big, loud, different and fun. There's that period of apprehension when you're not sure if maybe you added too many habeñeros, or the oil from the peanut butter will make your beer feel slick, or the cocoa powder will make the beer chalky. So far we've been fortunate enough to always make at the very least quaffable beer. Most of the time, it's beer we've really enjoyed drinking.

This was how I started out. I was making beers that I'd never seen before (although certainly many have made similar beers before I did). Then, last summer I made a [Rye Saison](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/2012/07/recipe-rye-saison/ "Recipe: Rye Saison") that was largely a classic saison with just a small twist. The malt spiciness from the added rye worked to enhance the pepperiness from the yeast (Wyeast 3711). It wasn't some crazy, out there beer. It was a classic, almost to style beer with a small twist that served to enhance what would expect from the beer.

What I've realized is that this is often times much more difficult than doing something crazy. It requires a deep knowledge of the ingredients, their flavor profiles and how these flavors work in concert and affect one another. I think this is the challenge taken on by the brewers in the TBA Brown Ale.

TBA is a brown ale brewed with brown sugar and molasses, two flavors that really serve to enhance the malty backbone of a good brown ale. In the description, written by Bear Republic's Richard Norgrove Jr., it states:

> The unifying goal was to create a new variation on an old style. Brown ales are often misunderstood, hard to brew, and even harder name

It's a worthy goal. Brown ales are often overlooked by beer enthusiasts. They often lie far from any extremes. I think even their status as a great entry to the world of craft beer may be held against them. It's good to see brewers often known for their hop heavy beers take a crack at elevating a subtle, middle of the road ale.

### Tasting Notes

**Appearance**: The head formed so quickly as I poured this beer that I almost made a mess. Once it settled down, the beer was a cloudy rust color with a two finger tan head that is still receding down the glass.

**Aroma**: The beer has a strong hop note in the nose. It isn't overwhelming, and it's completely balanced by the sweetness in the malt and molasses. A nicely balanced aroma.

**Taste**: A beer brewed with brown sugar and molasses has a good chance of being too sweet, but this beer is nice and dry. There's the flavor from the dark sugars, but not much residual sweetness. The hops keep it dry without trending toward black IPA.

**Mouthfeel**: There's a lively carbonation that keeps this beer bright and lively. It feels a bit sharp, but not necessarily in a bad way.

**Overall**: Unlike some of the other Stone Collaborations, this one seemed to be less adventuresome. Maybe it's difficult to make a crazy brown ale, but that doesn't mean this isn't a good beer. They made something tasty, if not incredibly interesting.
