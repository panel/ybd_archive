Beer Trip: Short's Brewing Company
==================================

Though it hasn't made as many [appearances on these pages](http://www.yeastboundanddown.com/tag/shorts-brew/) as I would expect, it's fair to say that all three contributors to  this site are big fans of Short's Brewing. Their beers can be hit-or-miss, sure, but the main thing is this: _they're trying crazy shit_. We're big fans of experimentation in brewing, and there aren't many widely-distributed breweries that are willing to do things like make a bloody mary-themed beer, complete with salty flavor, etc.

So, I've said all this to preface an admission: despite our love for Short's, and numerous experiences drinking their products, none of us has ever made the trip to Northern Michigan to experience Short's in the flesh.

Until now.

Thanks to a wedding in Traverse City, I found myself in the wild North of Michigan, and - as the plus-one of a member of the bridal party - an entire day with nothing to do. It is common sense what Short's is, but I continued to journey on.

### Location

I knew Bellaire was in the middle of nowhere, but man, Bellaire is in the middle of _nowhere_. From Traverse City, there are primary routes to take: along the Grand Traverse Bay, or around the other side of Torch and Elk Lakes to the East.

"Glory" is a term used loosely in this instance. Sweet rearview, bro.\[/caption\]

Since the Short's production facility is actually in Elk Rapids, about 30 miles from Bellaire, I took the Western route on the way up, and swung by the factory to experience its glory. It was not thrilling, and certainly not while I was just swinging by as I hustled to make it to the brewpub itself.

Elk Rapids is no metropolis itself, but is actually in a pretty cool location, on the channel between Elk Lake and the Grand Traverse Bay. As I said, I didn't head into the town itself too much.

As for the brewpub itself, I've already mentioned that it's... remote... and that's the case. The town of Bellaire consisted entirely of a couple blocks, and the brewery is on the Western edge of that town.

### Setting and Atmosphere

Bellaire is a quintessential resort town (but with no real reason to visit, other than the variety of lakes a short distance away, I guess), and Short's is one of the few things that seems like it would bring people into the town. From the outside, it's an unassuming building as part of a city block.

Stepping inside, however, thinks go from up North casual to that bustling feeling we've all come to know and love in brewpubs. All orders are taken at the counter - be they for food or beer - but wait staff actually brings the product to you once you grab a table flag and find a seat in one of two rooms.

The bar room is the one you enter walking into the storefront, but near the back of the space, there is a short set of stairs down into a larger (or at least more spacious) room. In that room, there is a nice stage for live music, and a number of hightop tables along the walls, and standard low-top tables with seating along the middle.

I would have love to have the opportunity to see some live music there, and if it wasn't so remote, I would make a trip just to see that (and to get some more interesting beers - more about that in a moment). As it stands, it's likely something that won't happen without a special set of circumstances.

### The Beer

So, I mention that there weren't many great beers - or at least not exciting ones - on my trip to Short's. That is in direct contradiction with my opening paragraphs, no?

Well, my speculation (the place was busy enough that I didn't want to hassle any waitstaff about it) is that, thanks to the Michigan Brewer's Guild summer festival in just a couple weeks, they're holding off on presenting many creative offerings in the brewpub until after that event.

Regardless, I wasn't going to drive that far North without trying a few brews - albeit a couple I'd had before - so I picked up a flight. The image at right shows (from near to far): 2009 Golden Rule, Alter Spalter, Autumn Ale, Spruce Pils, and The Magician.

The Spruce Pils tastes downright earthy, green, planty... it has the same flavor of the smell of a certain substance. I've had it before, this came as no surprise.

The beer that did surprise me - and again, it's one I'd had before - was The Magician. It's a nice brown ale, with plenty of toffee and caramel tastes in the malt experience. It's lightly hopped - though the Short's menu mentioned that makes it ideal for newcomers to beer (with the implication that it's not good for anyone else), about which I couldn't roll my eyes hard enough.

The other three beers were mostly non-notable. They were good, solid beers, as is expected. Any other week(s) of the year, however, I wouldn't have even bothered ordering them, instead opting for one of the more creative offerings you'd typically see on draft.

### Summary

Short's is known as a good brewery, and making the trip didn't do anything to dissuade me from thinking that. It's in the middle of nowhere, both an annoyance and part of what makes it so special. It's worth making the journey only if you're headed in that direction anyway, but on a standard week with a more creative beer list - and the chance to see a bit of live music 0 it can make for an excellent experience.
