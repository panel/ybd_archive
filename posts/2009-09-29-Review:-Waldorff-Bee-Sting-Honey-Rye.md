Size: 22 fl oz. bottle

Alcohol: 6.5% ABV

Bitterness: 15 IBU

Pours amber, with a thin creamy-colored head that settles quickly with very little lattice. Malty smell, with few other scents. On first taste, the rye flavor is evident, but there isn't much honey flavor. It does have a sweetness that is somewhat malty, but also due to the presence of the honey. Medium-to-high carbonation, with a mouthfeel in the middle of the spectrum. Leaves a malty aftertaste, not too much rye flavor afterwards.

I'd drink it again, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to get it (and really, is Hastings on the way to anything?)
