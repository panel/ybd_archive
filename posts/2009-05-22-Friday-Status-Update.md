Friday Status Update
====================

The beer is fermenting, as evidenced by the bubbling and whatnot. It's starting to smell hoppier than it did. It appears the yeast is going to town on the malt, which is really reducing the pumpkin smell.  The closet where we are storing the carboy smells deliciously like beer.  Still lagging behind on the, like, posting actual information. Informative update still pending, along with the photos we took on day 1.
