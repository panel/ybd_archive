English Stout Recipe
====================

We came up with this recipe because we wanted to try to reuse our yeast from the Strong Mild. We were going for a fairly malty, sweet stout.

### Ingredients

*   6.6lbs Pale Liquid Malt Extract

*   1lb Roasted Barley

*   1lb 120L Crystal Malt

*   0.5lb Chocolate Malt

*   0.5lb Lactose

*   2oz Northern Brewer Hops (≈6% AA)

### Process

We put the roasted barley, crystal and chocalate malt in a muslin bag and put it in 3.5gals of water. We turned on the heat and let the grains steep until the water hit 170ºF.  We pulled out the grain and brought the tea to a boil.  We added 1/4 of the LME and 1oz of the hops.  Let it boil for 45 minutes then add 1tsp of Irish Moss and the lactose.  We added the other ounce of hops in the primary.

### Initial Impressions

It seems a bit too light, and may be a bit too sweet. We'll be moving it to bottles pretty soon, so hopefully we can get a better idea of it then.
