Review: Birra Moretti
=====================

Though I'm not sure it qualifies as a "craft beer," I'd certainly never tried Birra Moretti until recently, and therefore a review is in the offing. The brand was formed in 1859 by Luigi Moretti and since 1996 has been owned by Heineken International.

As is obvious from the included picture, Birra Moretti is a light lager, though there are [seven other beers](http://www.ratebeer.com/brewers/birra-moretti-(heineken)/389/) produced under the Birra Moretti label.

The beer was similar to your standard American macros, with very little hop flavor, and to be honest, very little flavor at all. The one thing I did notice is that it had a fruity sweetness, like a lot of other European Pilsner-type beers. Pilsner Urquell, for example, springs to mind as a great example of this fruity sweetness.

All other aspects were as expected, though it was a little flatter than many American Light Lagers. The finish was clean with very little aftertaste, the mouthfeel was pretty light, almost like lightly carbonated water, and the aroma was very weak. There was a hint of that sweetness in the nose, but not as much as te flavor.
