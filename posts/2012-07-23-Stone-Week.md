Stone Week
==========

This wasn't really planned, but I ended up picking up a bunch of Stone beers the past few weeks. Turns out I got up 5, so we might as well do a full week of reviews. Most of them are somewhat out there, which is exciting.

Stone could very easily rest on its laurels and just print money by brewing Arrogant Bastard. They must brew a ton of that, but I'm still always seeing new and exciting beers from them. It's great to see one of the leaders in the Craft Beer industry still crafting and tinkering.
